of 1 the 1 Middle 1 Ages 1 PART 1 ONE 1 Chapter 1 I: 1 The 1 Bertolini 1 \u201cThe 1 Signora 1 had 1 no 1 business 1 to 1 do 1 it,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 \u201cno 1 business 1 at 1 all. 1 She 1 promised 1 us 1 south 1 rooms 1 with 1 a 1 view 1 close 1 together, 1 instead 1 of 1 which 1 here 1 are 1 north 1 rooms, 1 looking 1 into 1 a 1 courtyard, 1 and 1 a 1 long 1 way 1 apart. 1 Oh, 1 Lucy!\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 a 1 Cockney, 1 besides!\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 had 1 been 1 further 1 saddened 1 by 1 the 1 Signora\u2019s 1 unexpected 1 accent. 1 \u201cIt 1 might 1 be 1 London.\u201d 1 She 1 looked 1 at 1 the 1 two 1 rows 1 of 1 English 1 people 1 who 1 were 1 sitting 1 at 1 the 1 table; 1 at 1 the 1 row 1 of 1 white 1 bottles 1 of 1 water 1 and 1 red 1 bottles 1 of 1 wine 1 that 1 ran 1 between 1 the 1 English 1 people; 1 at 1 the 1 portraits 1 of 1 the 1 late 1 Queen 1 and 1 the 1 late 1 Poet 1 Laureate 1 that 1 hung 1 behind 1 the 1 English 1 people, 1 heavily 1 framed; 1 at 1 the 1 notice 1 of 1 the 1 English 1 church 1 (Rev. 1 Cuthbert 1 Eager, 1 M. 1 A. 1 Oxon.), 1 that 1 was 1 the 1 only 1 other 1 decoration 1 of 1 the 1 wall. 1 \u201cCharlotte, 1 don\u2019t 1 you 1 feel, 1 too, 1 that 1 we 1 might 1 be 1 in 1 London? 1 I 1 can 1 hardly 1 believe 1 that 1 all 1 kinds 1 of 1 other 1 things 1 are 1 just 1 outside. 1 I 1 suppose 1 it 1 is 1 one\u2019s 1 being 1 so 1 tired.\u201d 1 \u201cThis 1 meat 1 has 1 surely 1 been 1 used 1 for 1 soup,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 laying 1 down 1 her 1 fork. 1 \u201cI 1 want 1 so 1 to 1 see 1 the 1 Arno. 1 The 1 rooms 1 the 1 Signora 1 promised 1 us 1 in 1 her 1 letter 1 would 1 have 1 looked 1 over 1 the 1 Arno. 1 The 1 Signora 1 had 1 no 1 business 1 to 1 do 1 it 1 at 1 all. 1 Oh, 1 it 1 is 1 a 1 shame!\u201d 1 \u201cAny 1 nook 1 does 1 for 1 me,\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 continued; 1 \u201cbut 1 it 1 does 1 seem 1 hard 1 that 1 you 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 have 1 a 1 view.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 felt 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 been 1 selfish. 1 \u201cCharlotte, 1 you 1 mustn\u2019t 1 spoil 1 me: 1 of 1 course, 1 you 1 must 1 look 1 over 1 the 1 Arno, 1 too. 1 I 1 meant 1 that. 1 The 1 first 1 vacant 1 room 1 in 1 the 1 front--\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 must 1 have 1 it,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 part 1 of 1 whose 1 travelling 1 expenses 1 were 1 paid 1 by 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 mother--a 1 piece 1 of 1 generosity 1 to 1 which 1 she 1 made 1 many 1 a 1 tactful 1 allusion. 1 \u201cNo, 1 no. 1 You 1 must 1 have 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 insist 1 on 1 it. 1 Your 1 mother 1 would 1 never 1 forgive 1 me, 1 Lucy.\u201d 1 \u201cShe 1 would 1 never 1 forgive 1 me.\u201d 1 The 1 ladies\u2019 1 voices 1 grew 1 animated, 1 and--if 1 the 1 sad 1 truth 1 be 1 owned--a 1 little 1 peevish. 1 They 1 were 1 tired, 1 and 1 under 1 the 1 guise 1 of 1 unselfishness 1 they 1 wrangled. 1 Some 1 of 1 their 1 neighbours 1 interchanged 1 glances, 1 and 1 one 1 of 1 them--one 1 of 1 the 1 ill-bred 1 people 1 whom 1 one 1 does 1 meet 1 abroad--leant 1 forward 1 over 1 the 1 table 1 and 1 actually 1 intruded 1 into 1 their 1 argument. 1 He 1 said: 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 a 1 view, 1 I 1 have 1 a 1 view.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 startled. 1 Generally 1 at 1 a 1 pension 1 people 1 looked 1 them 1 over 1 for 1 a 1 day 1 or 1 two 1 before 1 speaking, 1 and 1 often 1 did 1 not 1 find 1 out 1 that 1 they 1 would 1 \u201cdo\u201d 1 till 1 they 1 had 1 gone. 1 She 1 knew 1 that 1 the 1 intruder 1 was 1 ill-bred, 1 even 1 before 1 she 1 glanced 1 at 1 him. 1 He 1 was 1 an 1 old 1 man, 1 of 1 heavy 1 build, 1 with 1 a 1 fair, 1 shaven 1 face 1 and 1 large 1 eyes. 1 There 1 was 1 something 1 childish 1 in 1 those 1 eyes, 1 though 1 it 1 was 1 not 1 the 1 childishness 1 of 1 senility. 1 What 1 exactly 1 it 1 was 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 did 1 not 1 stop 1 to 1 consider, 1 for 1 her 1 glance 1 passed 1 on 1 to 1 his 1 clothes. 1 These 1 did 1 not 1 attract 1 her. 1 He 1 was 1 probably 1 trying 1 to 1 become 1 acquainted 1 with 1 them 1 before 1 they 1 got 1 into 1 the 1 swim. 1 So 1 she 1 assumed 1 a 1 dazed 1 expression 1 when 1 he 1 spoke 1 to 1 her, 1 and 1 then 1 said: 1 \u201cA 1 view? 1 Oh, 1 a 1 view! 1 How 1 delightful 1 a 1 view 1 is!\u201d 1 \u201cThis 1 is 1 my 1 son,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 old 1 man; 1 \u201chis 1 name\u2019s 1 George. 1 He 1 has 1 a 1 view 1 too.\u201d 1 \u201cAh,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 repressing 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 was 1 about 1 to 1 speak. 1 \u201cWhat 1 I 1 mean,\u201d 1 he 1 continued, 1 \u201cis 1 that 1 you 1 can 1 have 1 our 1 rooms, 1 and 1 we\u2019ll 1 have 1 yours. 1 We\u2019ll 1 change.\u201d 1 The 1 better 1 class 1 of 1 tourist 1 was 1 shocked 1 at 1 this, 1 and 1 sympathized 1 with 1 the 1 new-comers. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 in 1 reply, 1 opened 1 her 1 mouth 1 as 1 little 1 as 1 possible, 1 and 1 said 1 \u201cThank 1 you 1 very 1 much 1 indeed; 1 that 1 is 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 question.\u201d 1 \u201cWhy?\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 old 1 man, 1 with 1 both 1 fists 1 on 1 the 1 table. 1 \u201cBecause 1 it 1 is 1 quite 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 question, 1 thank 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 see, 1 we 1 don\u2019t 1 like 1 to 1 take--\u201d 1 began 1 Lucy. 1 Her 1 cousin 1 again 1 repressed 1 her. 1 \u201cBut 1 why?\u201d 1 he 1 persisted. 1 \u201cWomen 1 like 1 looking 1 at 1 a 1 view; 1 men 1 don\u2019t.\u201d 1 And 1 he 1 thumped 1 with 1 his 1 fists 1 like 1 a 1 naughty 1 child, 1 and 1 turned 1 to 1 his 1 son, 1 saying, 1 \u201cGeorge, 1 persuade 1 them!\u201d 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 so 1 obvious 1 they 1 should 1 have 1 the 1 rooms,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 son. 1 \u201cThere\u2019s 1 nothing 1 else 1 to 1 say.\u201d 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 look 1 at 1 the 1 ladies 1 as 1 he 1 spoke, 1 but 1 his 1 voice 1 was 1 perplexed 1 and 1 sorrowful. 1 Lucy, 1 too, 1 was 1 perplexed; 1 but 1 she 1 saw 1 that 1 they 1 were 1 in 1 for 1 what 1 is 1 known 1 as 1 \u201cquite 1 a 1 scene,\u201d 1 and 1 she 1 had 1 an 1 odd 1 feeling 1 that 1 whenever 1 these 1 ill-bred 1 tourists 1 spoke 1 the 1 contest 1 widened 1 and 1 deepened 1 till 1 it 1 dealt, 1 not 1 with 1 rooms 1 and 1 views, 1 but 1 with--well, 1 with 1 something 1 quite 1 different, 1 whose 1 existence 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 realized 1 before. 1 Now 1 the 1 old 1 man 1 attacked 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 almost 1 violently: 1 Why 1 should 1 she 1 not 1 change? 1 What 1 possible 1 objection 1 had 1 she? 1 They 1 would 1 clear 1 out 1 in 1 half 1 an 1 hour. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 though 1 skilled 1 in 1 the 1 delicacies 1 of 1 conversation, 1 was 1 powerless 1 in 1 the 1 presence 1 of 1 brutality. 1 It 1 was 1 impossible 1 to 1 snub 1 any 1 one 1 so 1 gross. 1 Her 1 face 1 reddened 1 with 1 displeasure. 1 She 1 looked 1 around 1 as 1 much 1 as 1 to 1 say, 1 \u201cAre 1 you 1 all 1 like 1 this?\u201d 1 And 1 two 1 little 1 old 1 ladies, 1 who 1 were 1 sitting 1 further 1 up 1 the 1 table, 1 with 1 shawls 1 hanging 1 over 1 the 1 backs 1 of 1 the 1 chairs, 1 looked 1 back, 1 clearly 1 indicating 1 \u201cWe 1 are 1 not; 1 we 1 are 1 genteel.\u201d 1 \u201cEat 1 your 1 dinner, 1 dear,\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 to 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 began 1 to 1 toy 1 again 1 with 1 the 1 meat 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 once 1 censured. 1 Lucy 1 mumbled 1 that 1 those 1 seemed 1 very 1 odd 1 people 1 opposite. 1 \u201cEat 1 your 1 dinner, 1 dear. 1 This 1 pension 1 is 1 a 1 failure. 1 To-morrow 1 we 1 will 1 make 1 a 1 change.\u201d 1 Hardly 1 had 1 she 1 announced 1 this 1 fell 1 decision 1 when 1 she 1 reversed 1 it. 1 The 1 curtains 1 at 1 the 1 end 1 of 1 the 1 room 1 parted, 1 and 1 revealed 1 a 1 clergyman, 1 stout 1 but 1 attractive, 1 who 1 hurried 1 forward 1 to 1 take 1 his 1 place 1 at 1 the 1 table, 1 cheerfully 1 apologizing 1 for 1 his 1 lateness. 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 had 1 not 1 yet 1 acquired 1 decency, 1 at 1 once 1 rose 1 to 1 her 1 feet, 1 exclaiming: 1 \u201cOh, 1 oh! 1 Why, 1 it\u2019s 1 Mr. 1 Beebe! 1 Oh, 1 how 1 perfectly 1 lovely! 1 Oh, 1 Charlotte, 1 we 1 must 1 stop 1 now, 1 however 1 bad 1 the 1 rooms 1 are. 1 Oh!\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 said, 1 with 1 more 1 restraint: 1 \u201cHow 1 do 1 you 1 do, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe? 1 I 1 expect 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 forgotten 1 us: 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 and 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 who 1 were 1 at 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells 1 when 1 you 1 helped 1 the 1 Vicar 1 of 1 St. 1 Peter\u2019s 1 that 1 very 1 cold 1 Easter.\u201d 1 The 1 clergyman, 1 who 1 had 1 the 1 air 1 of 1 one 1 on 1 a 1 holiday, 1 did 1 not 1 remember 1 the 1 ladies 1 quite 1 as 1 clearly 1 as 1 they 1 remembered 1 him. 1 But 1 he 1 came 1 forward 1 pleasantly 1 enough 1 and 1 accepted 1 the 1 chair 1 into 1 which 1 he 1 was 1 beckoned 1 by 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cI 1 AM 1 so 1 glad 1 to 1 see 1 you,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 girl, 1 who 1 was 1 in 1 a 1 state 1 of 1 spiritual 1 starvation, 1 and 1 would 1 have 1 been 1 glad 1 to 1 see 1 the 1 waiter 1 if 1 her 1 cousin 1 had 1 permitted 1 it. 1 \u201cJust 1 fancy 1 how 1 small 1 the 1 world 1 is. 1 Summer 1 Street, 1 too, 1 makes 1 it 1 so 1 specially 1 funny.\u201d 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch 1 lives 1 in 1 the 1 parish 1 of 1 Summer 1 Street,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 filling 1 up 1 the 1 gap, 1 \u201cand 1 she 1 happened 1 to 1 tell 1 me 1 in 1 the 1 course 1 of 1 conversation 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 just 1 accepted 1 the 1 living--\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 I 1 heard 1 from 1 mother 1 so 1 last 1 week. 1 She 1 didn\u2019t 1 know 1 that 1 I 1 knew 1 you 1 at 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells; 1 but 1 I 1 wrote 1 back 1 at 1 once, 1 and 1 I 1 said: 1 \u2018Mr. 1 Beebe 1 is--\u2019\u201d 1 \u201cQuite 1 right,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 clergyman. 1 \u201cI 1 move 1 into 1 the 1 Rectory 1 at 1 Summer 1 Street 1 next 1 June. 1 I 1 am 1 lucky 1 to 1 be 1 appointed 1 to 1 such 1 a 1 charming 1 neighbourhood.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 how 1 glad 1 I 1 am! 1 The 1 name 1 of 1 our 1 house 1 is 1 Windy 1 Corner.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 bowed. 1 \u201cThere 1 is 1 mother 1 and 1 me 1 generally, 1 and 1 my 1 brother, 1 though 1 it\u2019s 1 not 1 often 1 we 1 get 1 him 1 to 1 ch---- 1 The 1 church 1 is 1 rather 1 far 1 off, 1 I 1 mean.\u201d 1 \u201cLucy, 1 dearest, 1 let 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 eat 1 his 1 dinner.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 eating 1 it, 1 thank 1 you, 1 and 1 enjoying 1 it.\u201d 1 He 1 preferred 1 to 1 talk 1 to 1 Lucy, 1 whose 1 playing 1 he 1 remembered, 1 rather 1 than 1 to 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 probably 1 remembered 1 his 1 sermons. 1 He 1 asked 1 the 1 girl 1 whether 1 she 1 knew 1 Florence 1 well, 1 and 1 was 1 informed 1 at 1 some 1 length 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 never 1 been 1 there 1 before. 1 It 1 is 1 delightful 1 to 1 advise 1 a 1 newcomer, 1 and 1 he 1 was 1 first 1 in 1 the 1 field. 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 neglect 1 the 1 country 1 round,\u201d 1 his 1 advice 1 concluded. 1 \u201cThe 1 first 1 fine 1 afternoon 1 drive 1 up 1 to 1 Fiesole, 1 and 1 round 1 by 1 Settignano, 1 or 1 something 1 of 1 that 1 sort.\u201d 1 \u201cNo!\u201d 1 cried 1 a 1 voice 1 from 1 the 1 top 1 of 1 the 1 table. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe, 1 you 1 are 1 wrong. 1 The 1 first 1 fine 1 afternoon 1 your 1 ladies 1 must 1 go 1 to 1 Prato.\u201d 1 \u201cThat 1 lady 1 looks 1 so 1 clever,\u201d 1 whispered 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 to 1 her 1 cousin. 1 \u201cWe 1 are 1 in 1 luck.\u201d 1 And, 1 indeed, 1 a 1 perfect 1 torrent 1 of 1 information 1 burst 1 on 1 them. 1 People 1 told 1 them 1 what 1 to 1 see, 1 when 1 to 1 see 1 it, 1 how 1 to 1 stop 1 the 1 electric 1 trams, 1 how 1 to 1 get 1 rid 1 of 1 the 1 beggars, 1 how 1 much 1 to 1 give 1 for 1 a 1 vellum 1 blotter, 1 how 1 much 1 the 1 place 1 would 1 grow 1 upon 1 them. 1 The 1 Pension 1 Bertolini 1 had 1 decided, 1 almost 1 enthusiastically, 1 that 1 they 1 would 1 do. 1 Whichever 1 way 1 they 1 looked, 1 kind 1 ladies 1 smiled 1 and 1 shouted 1 at 1 them. 1 And 1 above 1 For 1 that 1 man 1 has 1 murdered 1 his 1 wife 1 in 1 the 1 sight 1 of 1 God.\u201d 1 The 1 addition 1 of 1 God 1 was 1 striking. 1 But 1 the 1 chaplain 1 was 1 really 1 trying 1 to 1 qualify 1 a 1 rash 1 remark. 1 A 1 silence 1 followed 1 which 1 might 1 have 1 been 1 impressive, 1 but 1 was 1 merely 1 awkward. 1 Then 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 hastily 1 purchased 1 the 1 Leaning 1 Tower, 1 and 1 led 1 the 1 way 1 into 1 the 1 street. 1 \u201cI 1 must 1 be 1 going,\u201d 1 said 1 he, 1 shutting 1 his 1 eyes 1 and 1 taking 1 out 1 his 1 watch. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 thanked 1 him 1 for 1 his 1 kindness, 1 and 1 spoke 1 with 1 enthusiasm 1 of 1 the 1 approaching 1 drive. 1 \u201cDrive? 1 Oh, 1 is 1 our 1 drive 1 to 1 come 1 off?\u201d 1 Lucy 1 was 1 recalled 1 to 1 her 1 manners, 1 and 1 after 1 a 1 little 1 exertion 1 the 1 complacency 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 was 1 restored. 1 \u201cBother 1 the 1 drive!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 the 1 girl, 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 he 1 had 1 departed. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 just 1 the 1 drive 1 we 1 had 1 arranged 1 with 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 without 1 any 1 fuss 1 at 1 all. 1 Why 1 should 1 he 1 invite 1 us 1 in 1 that 1 absurd 1 manner? 1 We 1 might 1 as 1 well 1 invite 1 him. 1 We 1 are 1 each 1 paying 1 for 1 ourselves.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 had 1 intended 1 to 1 lament 1 over 1 the 1 Emersons, 1 was 1 launched 1 by 1 this 1 remark 1 into 1 unexpected 1 thoughts. 1 \u201cIf 1 that 1 is 1 so, 1 dear--if 1 the 1 drive 1 we 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 are 1 going 1 with 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 is 1 really 1 the 1 same 1 as 1 the 1 one 1 we 1 are 1 going 1 with 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 then 1 I 1 foresee 1 a 1 sad 1 kettle 1 of 1 fish.\u201d 1 \u201cHow?\u201d 1 \u201cBecause 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 has 1 asked 1 Eleanor 1 Lavish 1 to 1 come, 1 too.\u201d 1 \u201cThat 1 will 1 mean 1 another 1 carriage.\u201d 1 \u201cFar 1 worse. 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 does 1 not 1 like 1 Eleanor. 1 She 1 knows 1 it 1 herself. 1 The 1 truth 1 must 1 be 1 told; 1 she 1 is 1 too 1 unconventional 1 for 1 him.\u201d 1 They 1 were 1 now 1 in 1 the 1 newspaper-room 1 at 1 the 1 English 1 bank. 1 Lucy 1 stood 1 by 1 the 1 central 1 table, 1 heedless 1 of 1 Punch 1 and 1 the 1 Graphic, 1 trying 1 to 1 answer, 1 or 1 at 1 all 1 events 1 to 1 formulate 1 the 1 questions 1 rioting 1 in 1 her 1 brain. 1 The 1 well-known 1 world 1 had 1 broken 1 up, 1 and 1 there 1 emerged 1 Florence, 1 a 1 magic 1 city 1 where 1 people 1 thought 1 and 1 did 1 the 1 most 1 extraordinary 1 things. 1 Murder, 1 accusations 1 of 1 murder, 1 a 1 lady 1 clinging 1 to 1 one 1 man 1 and 1 being 1 rude 1 to 1 another--were 1 these 1 the 1 daily 1 incidents 1 of 1 her 1 streets? 1 Was 1 there 1 more 1 in 1 her 1 frank 1 beauty 1 than 1 met 1 the 1 eye--the 1 power, 1 perhaps, 1 to 1 evoke 1 passions, 1 good 1 and 1 bad, 1 and 1 to 1 bring 1 them 1 speedily 1 to 1 a 1 fulfillment? 1 Happy 1 Charlotte, 1 who, 1 though 1 greatly 1 troubled 1 over 1 things 1 that 1 did 1 not 1 matter, 1 seemed 1 oblivious 1 to 1 things 1 that 1 did; 1 who 1 could 1 conjecture 1 with 1 admirable 1 delicacy 1 \u201cwhere 1 things 1 might 1 lead 1 to,\u201d 1 but 1 apparently 1 lost 1 sight 1 of 1 the 1 goal 1 as 1 she 1 approached 1 it. 1 Now 1 she 1 was 1 crouching 1 in 1 the 1 corner 1 trying 1 to 1 extract 1 a 1 circular 1 note 1 from 1 a 1 kind 1 of 1 linen 1 nose-bag 1 which 1 hung 1 in 1 chaste 1 concealment 1 round 1 her 1 neck. 1 She 1 had 1 been 1 told 1 that 1 this 1 was 1 the 1 only 1 safe 1 way 1 to 1 carry 1 money 1 in 1 Italy; 1 it 1 must 1 only 1 be 1 broached 1 within 1 the 1 walls 1 of 1 the 1 English 1 bank. 1 As 1 she 1 groped 1 she 1 murmured: 1 \u201cWhether 1 it 1 is 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 who 1 forgot 1 to 1 tell 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 or 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 who 1 forgot 1 when 1 he 1 told 1 us, 1 or 1 whether 1 they 1 have 1 decided 1 to 1 leave 1 Eleanor 1 out 1 altogether--which 1 they 1 could 1 scarcely 1 do--but 1 in 1 any 1 case 1 we 1 must 1 be 1 prepared. 1 It 1 is 1 you 1 they 1 really 1 want; 1 I 1 am 1 only 1 asked 1 for 1 appearances. 1 You 1 shall 1 go 1 with 1 the 1 two 1 gentlemen, 1 and 1 I 1 and 1 Eleanor 1 will 1 follow 1 behind. 1 A 1 one-horse 1 carriage 1 would 1 do 1 for 1 us. 1 Yet 1 how 1 difficult 1 it 1 is!\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 indeed,\u201d 1 replied 1 the 1 girl, 1 with 1 a 1 gravity 1 that 1 sounded 1 sympathetic. 1 \u201cWhat 1 do 1 you 1 think 1 about 1 it?\u201d 1 asked 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 flushed 1 from 1 the 1 struggle, 1 and 1 buttoning 1 up 1 her 1 dress. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 what 1 I 1 think, 1 nor 1 what 1 I 1 want.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 dear, 1 Lucy! 1 I 1 do 1 hope 1 Florence 1 isn\u2019t 1 boring 1 you. 1 Speak 1 the 1 word, 1 and, 1 as 1 you 1 know, 1 I 1 would 1 take 1 you 1 to 1 the 1 ends 1 of 1 the 1 earth 1 to-morrow.\u201d 1 \u201cThank 1 you, 1 Charlotte,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 pondered 1 over 1 the 1 offer. 1 There 1 were 1 letters 1 for 1 her 1 at 1 the 1 bureau--one 1 from 1 her 1 brother, 1 full 1 of 1 athletics 1 and 1 biology; 1 one 1 from 1 her 1 mother, 1 delightful 1 as 1 only 1 her 1 mother\u2019s 1 letters 1 could 1 be. 1 She 1 had 1 read 1 in 1 it 1 of 1 the 1 crocuses 1 which 1 had 1 been 1 bought 1 for 1 yellow 1 and 1 were 1 coming 1 up 1 puce, 1 of 1 the 1 new 1 parlour-maid, 1 who 1 had 1 watered 1 the 1 ferns 1 with 1 essence 1 of 1 lemonade, 1 of 1 the 1 semi-detached 1 cottages 1 which 1 were 1 ruining 1 Summer 1 Street, 1 and 1 breaking 1 the 1 heart 1 of 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway. 1 She 1 recalled 1 the 1 free, 1 pleasant 1 life 1 of 1 her 1 home, 1 where 1 she 1 was 1 allowed 1 to 1 do 1 everything, 1 and 1 where 1 nothing 1 ever 1 happened 1 to 1 her. 1 The 1 road 1 up 1 through 1 the 1 pine-woods, 1 the 1 clean 1 drawing-room, 1 the 1 view 1 over 1 the 1 Sussex 1 Weald--all 1 hung 1 before 1 her 1 bright 1 and 1 distinct, 1 but 1 pathetic 1 as 1 the 1 pictures 1 in 1 a 1 gallery 1 to 1 which, 1 after 1 much 1 experience, 1 a 1 traveller 1 returns. 1 \u201cAnd 1 the 1 news?\u201d 1 asked 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cMrs. 1 Vyse 1 and 1 her 1 son 1 have 1 gone 1 to 1 Rome,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 giving 1 the 1 news 1 that 1 interested 1 her 1 least. 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 know 1 the 1 Vyses?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 not 1 that 1 way 1 back. 1 We 1 can 1 never 1 have 1 too 1 much 1 of 1 the 1 dear 1 Piazza 1 Signoria.\u201d 1 \u201cThey\u2019re 1 nice 1 people, 1 the 1 Vyses. 1 So 1 clever--my 1 idea 1 of 1 what\u2019s 1 really 1 clever. 1 Don\u2019t 1 you 1 long 1 to 1 be 1 in 1 Rome?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 die 1 for 1 it!\u201d 1 The 1 Piazza 1 Signoria 1 is 1 too 1 stony 1 to 1 be 1 brilliant. 1 It 1 has 1 no 1 grass, 1 no 1 flowers, 1 no 1 frescoes, 1 no 1 glittering 1 walls 1 of 1 marble 1 or 1 comforting 1 patches 1 of 1 ruddy 1 brick. 1 By 1 an 1 odd 1 chance--unless 1 we 1 believe 1 in 1 a 1 presiding 1 genius 1 of 1 places--the 1 statues 1 that 1 relieve 1 its 1 severity 1 suggest, 1 not 1 the 1 innocence 1 of 1 childhood, 1 nor 1 the 1 glorious 1 bewilderment 1 of 1 youth, 1 but 1 the 1 conscious 1 achievements 1 of 1 maturity. 1 Perseus 1 and 1 Judith, 1 Hercules 1 and 1 Thusnelda, 1 they 1 have 1 done 1 or 1 suffered 1 something, 1 and 1 though 1 they 1 are 1 immortal, 1 immortality 1 has 1 come 1 to 1 them 1 after 1 experience, 1 not 1 before. 1 Here, 1 not 1 only 1 in 1 the 1 solitude 1 of 1 Nature, 1 might 1 a 1 hero 1 meet 1 a 1 goddess, 1 or 1 a 1 heroine 1 a 1 god. 1 \u201cCharlotte!\u201d 1 cried 1 the 1 girl 1 suddenly. 1 \u201cHere\u2019s 1 an 1 idea. 1 What 1 if 1 we 1 popped 1 off 1 to 1 Rome 1 to-morrow--straight 1 to 1 the 1 Vyses\u2019 1 hotel? 1 For 1 I 1 do 1 know 1 what 1 I 1 want. 1 I\u2019m 1 sick 1 of 1 Florence. 1 No, 1 you 1 said 1 you\u2019d 1 go 1 to 1 the 1 ends 1 of 1 the 1 earth! 1 Do! 1 Do!\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 with 1 equal 1 vivacity, 1 replied: 1 \u201cOh, 1 you 1 droll 1 person! 1 Pray, 1 what 1 would 1 become 1 of 1 your 1 drive 1 in 1 the 1 hills?\u201d 1 They 1 passed 1 together 1 through 1 the 1 gaunt 1 beauty 1 of 1 the 1 square, 1 laughing 1 over 1 the 1 unpractical 1 suggestion. 1 Chapter 1 VI: 1 The 1 Reverend 1 Arthur 1 Beebe, 1 the 1 Reverend 1 Cuthbert 1 Eager, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 Mr. 1 George 1 Emerson, 1 Miss 1 Eleanor 1 Lavish, 1 Miss 1 Charlotte 1 Bartlett, 1 and 1 Miss 1 Lucy 1 Honeychurch 1 Drive 1 Out 1 in 1 Carriages 1 to 1 See 1 a 1 View; 1 Italians 1 Drive 1 Them. 1 It 1 was 1 Phaethon 1 who 1 drove 1 them 1 to 1 Fiesole 1 that 1 memorable 1 day, 1 a 1 youth 1 all 1 irresponsibility 1 and 1 fire, 1 recklessly 1 urging 1 his 1 master\u2019s 1 horses 1 up 1 the 1 stony 1 hill. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 recognized 1 him 1 at 1 once. 1 Neither 1 the 1 Ages 1 of 1 Faith 1 nor 1 the 1 Age 1 of 1 Doubt 1 had 1 touched 1 him; 1 he 1 was 1 Phaethon 1 in 1 Tuscany 1 driving 1 a 1 cab. 1 And 1 it 1 was 1 Persephone 1 whom 1 he 1 asked 1 leave 1 to 1 pick 1 up 1 on 1 the 1 way, 1 saying 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 his 1 sister--Persephone, 1 tall 1 and 1 slender 1 and 1 pale, 1 returning 1 with 1 the 1 Spring 1 to 1 her 1 mother\u2019s 1 cottage, 1 and 1 still 1 shading 1 her 1 eyes 1 from 1 the 1 unaccustomed 1 light. 1 To 1 her 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 objected, 1 saying 1 that 1 here 1 was 1 the 1 thin 1 edge 1 of 1 the 1 wedge, 1 and 1 one 1 must 1 guard 1 against 1 imposition. 1 But 1 the 1 ladies 1 interceded, 1 and 1 when 1 it 1 had 1 been 1 made 1 clear 1 that 1 it 1 was 1 a 1 very 1 great 1 favour, 1 the 1 goddess 1 was 1 allowed 1 to 1 mount 1 beside 1 the 1 god. 1 Phaethon 1 at 1 once 1 slipped 1 the 1 left 1 rein 1 over 1 her 1 head, 1 thus 1 enabling 1 himself 1 to 1 drive 1 with 1 his 1 arm 1 round 1 her 1 waist. 1 She 1 did 1 not 1 mind. 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 who 1 sat 1 with 1 his 1 back 1 to 1 the 1 horses, 1 saw 1 nothing 1 of 1 the 1 indecorous 1 proceeding, 1 and 1 continued 1 his 1 conversation 1 with 1 Lucy. 1 The 1 other 1 two 1 occupants 1 of 1 the 1 carriage 1 were 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 and 1 Miss 1 Lavish. 1 For 1 a 1 dreadful 1 thing 1 had 1 happened: 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 without 1 consulting 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 had 1 doubled 1 the 1 size 1 of 1 the 1 party. 1 And 1 though 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 and 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 planned 1 all 1 the 1 morning 1 how 1 the 1 people 1 were 1 to 1 sit, 1 at 1 the 1 critical 1 moment 1 when 1 the 1 carriages 1 came 1 round 1 they 1 lost 1 their 1 heads, 1 and 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 got 1 in 1 with 1 Lucy, 1 while 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 with 1 George 1 Emerson 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 followed 1 on 1 behind. 1 It 1 was 1 hard 1 on 1 the 1 poor 1 chaplain 1 to 1 have 1 his 1 partie 1 carree 1 thus 1 transformed. 1 Tea 1 at 1 a 1 Renaissance 1 villa, 1 if 1 he 1 had 1 ever 1 meditated 1 it, 1 was 1 now 1 impossible. 1 Lucy 1 and 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 a 1 certain 1 style 1 about 1 them, 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 though 1 unreliable, 1 was 1 a 1 man 1 of 1 parts. 1 But 1 a 1 shoddy 1 lady 1 writer 1 and 1 a 1 journalist 1 who 1 had 1 murdered 1 his 1 wife 1 in 1 the 1 sight 1 of 1 God--they 1 should 1 enter 1 no 1 villa 1 at 1 his 1 introduction. 1 Lucy, 1 elegantly 1 dressed 1 in 1 white, 1 sat 1 erect 1 and 1 nervous 1 amid 1 these 1 explosive 1 ingredients, 1 attentive 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 repressive 1 towards 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 watchful 1 of 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 hitherto 1 fortunately 1 asleep, 1 thanks 1 to 1 a 1 heavy 1 lunch 1 and 1 the 1 drowsy 1 atmosphere 1 of 1 Spring. 1 She 1 looked 1 on 1 the 1 expedition 1 as 1 the 1 work 1 of 1 Fate. 1 But 1 for 1 it 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 avoided 1 George 1 Emerson 1 successfully. 1 In 1 an 1 open 1 manner 1 he 1 had 1 shown 1 that 1 he 1 wished 1 to 1 continue 1 their 1 intimacy. 1 She 1 had 1 refused, 1 not 1 because 1 she 1 disliked 1 him, 1 but 1 because 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 know 1 what 1 had 1 happened, 1 and 1 suspected 1 that 1 he 1 did 1 know. 1 And 1 this 1 frightened 1 her. 1 For 1 the 1 real 1 event--whatever 1 it 1 was--had 1 taken 1 place, 1 not 1 in 1 the 1 Loggia, 1 but 1 by 1 the 1 river. 1 To 1 behave 1 wildly 1 at 1 the 1 sight 1 of 1 death 1 is 1 pardonable. 1 But 1 to 1 discuss 1 it 1 afterwards, 1 to 1 pass 1 from 1 discussion 1 into 1 silence, 1 and 1 through 1 silence 1 into 1 sympathy, 1 that 1 is 1 an 1 error, 1 not 1 of 1 a 1 startled 1 emotion, 1 but 1 of 1 the 1 whole 1 fabric. 1 There 1 was 1 really 1 something 1 blameworthy 1 (she 1 thought) 1 in 1 their 1 joint 1 contemplation 1 of 1 the 1 shadowy 1 stream, 1 in 1 the 1 common 1 impulse 1 which 1 had 1 turned 1 them 1 to 1 the 1 house 1 without 1 the 1 passing 1 of 1 a 1 look 1 or 1 word. 1 This 1 sense 1 of 1 wickedness 1 had 1 been 1 slight 1 at 1 first. 1 She 1 had 1 nearly 1 joined 1 the 1 party 1 to 1 the 1 Torre 1 del 1 Gallo. 1 But 1 each 1 time 1 that 1 she 1 avoided 1 George 1 it 1 became 1 more 1 imperative 1 that 1 she 1 should 1 avoid 1 him 1 again. 1 And 1 now 1 celestial 1 irony, 1 working 1 through 1 her 1 cousin 1 and 1 two 1 clergymen, 1 did 1 not 1 suffer 1 her 1 to 1 leave 1 Florence 1 till 1 she 1 had 1 made 1 this 1 expedition 1 with 1 him 1 through 1 the 1 hills. 1 Meanwhile 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 held 1 her 1 in 1 civil 1 converse; 1 their 1 little 1 tiff 1 was 1 over. 1 \u201cSo, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 you 1 are 1 travelling? 1 As 1 a 1 student 1 of 1 art?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 dear 1 me, 1 no--oh, 1 no!\u201d 1 \u201cPerhaps 1 as 1 a 1 student 1 of 1 human 1 nature,\u201d 1 interposed 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 \u201clike 1 myself?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 no. 1 I 1 am 1 here 1 as 1 a 1 tourist.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 indeed,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Eager. 1 \u201cAre 1 you 1 indeed? 1 If 1 you 1 will 1 not 1 think 1 me 1 rude, 1 we 1 residents 1 sometimes 1 pity 1 you 1 poor 1 tourists 1 not 1 leaving 1 his 1 family 1 rooted 1 in 1 the 1 best 1 society 1 obtainable. 1 The 1 best 1 obtainable. 1 Certainly 1 many 1 of 1 the 1 immigrants 1 were 1 rather 1 dull, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 realized 1 this 1 more 1 vividly 1 since 1 her 1 return 1 from 1 Italy. 1 Hitherto 1 she 1 had 1 accepted 1 their 1 ideals 1 without 1 questioning--their 1 kindly 1 affluence, 1 their 1 inexplosive 1 religion, 1 their 1 dislike 1 of 1 paper-bags, 1 orange-peel, 1 and 1 broken 1 bottles. 1 A 1 Radical 1 out 1 and 1 out, 1 she 1 learnt 1 to 1 speak 1 with 1 horror 1 of 1 Suburbia. 1 Life, 1 so 1 far 1 as 1 she 1 troubled 1 to 1 conceive 1 it, 1 was 1 a 1 circle 1 of 1 rich, 1 pleasant 1 people, 1 with 1 identical 1 interests 1 and 1 identical 1 foes. 1 In 1 this 1 circle, 1 one 1 thought, 1 married, 1 and 1 died. 1 Outside 1 it 1 were 1 poverty 1 and 1 vulgarity 1 for 1 ever 1 trying 1 to 1 enter, 1 just 1 as 1 the 1 London 1 fog 1 tries 1 to 1 enter 1 the 1 pine-woods 1 pouring 1 through 1 the 1 gaps 1 in 1 the 1 northern 1 hills. 1 But, 1 in 1 Italy, 1 where 1 any 1 one 1 who 1 chooses 1 may 1 warm 1 himself 1 in 1 equality, 1 as 1 in 1 the 1 sun, 1 this 1 conception 1 of 1 life 1 vanished. 1 Her 1 senses 1 expanded; 1 she 1 felt 1 that 1 there 1 was 1 no 1 one 1 whom 1 she 1 might 1 not 1 get 1 to 1 like, 1 that 1 social 1 barriers 1 were 1 irremovable, 1 doubtless, 1 but 1 not 1 particularly 1 high. 1 You 1 jump 1 over 1 them 1 just 1 as 1 you 1 jump 1 into 1 a 1 peasant\u2019s 1 olive-yard 1 in 1 the 1 Apennines, 1 and 1 he 1 is 1 glad 1 to 1 see 1 you. 1 She 1 returned 1 with 1 new 1 eyes. 1 So 1 did 1 Cecil; 1 but 1 Italy 1 had 1 quickened 1 Cecil, 1 not 1 to 1 tolerance, 1 but 1 to 1 irritation. 1 He 1 saw 1 that 1 the 1 local 1 society 1 was 1 narrow, 1 but, 1 instead 1 of 1 saying, 1 \u201cDoes 1 that 1 very 1 much 1 matter?\u201d 1 he 1 rebelled, 1 and 1 tried 1 to 1 substitute 1 for 1 it 1 the 1 society 1 he 1 called 1 broad. 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 realize 1 that 1 Lucy 1 had 1 consecrated 1 her 1 environment 1 by 1 the 1 thousand 1 little 1 civilities 1 that 1 create 1 a 1 tenderness 1 in 1 time, 1 and 1 that 1 though 1 her 1 eyes 1 saw 1 its 1 defects, 1 her 1 heart 1 refused 1 to 1 despise 1 it 1 entirely. 1 Nor 1 did 1 he 1 realize 1 a 1 more 1 important 1 point--that 1 if 1 she 1 was 1 too 1 great 1 for 1 this 1 society, 1 she 1 was 1 too 1 great 1 for 1 all 1 society, 1 and 1 had 1 reached 1 the 1 stage 1 where 1 personal 1 intercourse 1 would 1 alone 1 satisfy 1 her. 1 A 1 rebel 1 she 1 was, 1 but 1 not 1 of 1 the 1 kind 1 he 1 understood--a 1 rebel 1 who 1 desired, 1 not 1 a 1 wider 1 dwelling-room, 1 but 1 equality 1 beside 1 the 1 man 1 she 1 loved. 1 For 1 Italy 1 was 1 offering 1 her 1 the 1 most 1 priceless 1 of 1 all 1 possessions--her 1 own 1 soul. 1 Playing 1 bumble-puppy 1 with 1 Minnie 1 Beebe, 1 niece 1 to 1 the 1 rector, 1 and 1 aged 1 thirteen--an 1 ancient 1 and 1 most 1 honourable 1 game, 1 which 1 consists 1 in 1 striking 1 tennis-balls 1 high 1 into 1 the 1 air, 1 so 1 that 1 they 1 fall 1 over 1 the 1 net 1 and 1 immoderately 1 bounce; 1 some 1 hit 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch; 1 others 1 are 1 lost. 1 The 1 sentence 1 is 1 confused, 1 but 1 the 1 better 1 illustrates 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 state 1 of 1 mind, 1 for 1 she 1 was 1 trying 1 to 1 talk 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 at 1 the 1 same 1 time. 1 \u201cOh, 1 it 1 has 1 been 1 such 1 a 1 nuisance--first 1 he, 1 then 1 they--no 1 one 1 knowing 1 what 1 they 1 wanted, 1 and 1 everyone 1 so 1 tiresome.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 they 1 really 1 are 1 coming 1 now,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cI 1 wrote 1 to 1 Miss 1 Teresa 1 a 1 few 1 days 1 ago--she 1 was 1 wondering 1 how 1 often 1 the 1 butcher 1 called, 1 and 1 my 1 reply 1 of 1 once 1 a 1 month 1 must 1 have 1 impressed 1 her 1 favourably. 1 They 1 are 1 coming. 1 I 1 heard 1 from 1 them 1 this 1 morning. 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 hate 1 those 1 Miss 1 Alans!\u201d 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 cried. 1 \u201cJust 1 because 1 they\u2019re 1 old 1 and 1 silly 1 one\u2019s 1 expected 1 to 1 say 1 \u2018How 1 sweet!\u2019 1 I 1 hate 1 their 1 \u2018if\u2019-ing 1 and 1 \u2018but\u2019-ing 1 and 1 \u2018and\u2019-ing. 1 And 1 poor 1 Lucy--serve 1 her 1 right--worn 1 to 1 a 1 shadow.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 watched 1 the 1 shadow 1 springing 1 and 1 shouting 1 over 1 the 1 tennis-court. 1 Cecil 1 was 1 absent--one 1 did 1 not 1 play 1 bumble-puppy 1 when 1 he 1 was 1 there. 1 \u201cWell, 1 if 1 they 1 are 1 coming--No, 1 Minnie, 1 not 1 Saturn.\u201d 1 Saturn 1 was 1 a 1 tennis-ball 1 whose 1 skin 1 was 1 partially 1 unsewn. 1 When 1 in 1 motion 1 his 1 orb 1 was 1 encircled 1 by 1 a 1 ring. 1 \u201cIf 1 they 1 are 1 coming, 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 will 1 let 1 them 1 move 1 in 1 before 1 the 1 twenty-ninth, 1 and 1 he 1 will 1 cross 1 out 1 the 1 clause 1 about 1 whitewashing 1 the 1 ceilings, 1 because 1 it 1 made 1 them 1 nervous, 1 and 1 put 1 in 1 the 1 fair 1 wear 1 and 1 tear 1 one.--That 1 doesn\u2019t 1 count. 1 I 1 told 1 you 1 not 1 Saturn.\u201d 1 \u201cSaturn\u2019s 1 all 1 right 1 for 1 bumble-puppy,\u201d 1 cried 1 Freddy, 1 joining 1 them. 1 \u201cMinnie, 1 don\u2019t 1 you 1 listen 1 to 1 her.\u201d 1 \u201cSaturn 1 doesn\u2019t 1 bounce.\u201d 1 \u201cSaturn 1 bounces 1 enough.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 he 1 doesn\u2019t.\u201d 1 \u201cWell; 1 he 1 bounces 1 better 1 than 1 the 1 Beautiful 1 White 1 Devil.\u201d 1 \u201cHush, 1 dear,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch. 1 \u201cBut 1 look 1 at 1 Lucy--complaining 1 of 1 Saturn, 1 and 1 all 1 the 1 time\u2019s 1 got 1 the 1 Beautiful 1 White 1 Devil 1 in 1 her 1 hand, 1 ready 1 to 1 plug 1 it 1 in. 1 That\u2019s 1 right, 1 Minnie, 1 go 1 for 1 her--get 1 her 1 over 1 the 1 shins 1 with 1 the 1 racquet--get 1 her 1 over 1 the 1 shins!\u201d 1 Lucy 1 fell, 1 the 1 Beautiful 1 White 1 Devil 1 rolled 1 from 1 her 1 hand. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 picked 1 it 1 up, 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cThe 1 name 1 of 1 this 1 ball 1 is 1 Vittoria 1 Corombona, 1 please.\u201d 1 But 1 his 1 correction 1 passed 1 unheeded. 1 Freddy 1 possessed 1 to 1 a 1 high 1 degree 1 the 1 power 1 of 1 lashing 1 little 1 girls 1 to 1 fury, 1 and 1 in 1 half 1 a 1 minute 1 he 1 had 1 transformed 1 Minnie 1 from 1 a 1 well-mannered 1 child 1 into 1 a 1 howling 1 wilderness. 1 Up 1 in 1 the 1 house 1 Cecil 1 heard 1 them, 1 and, 1 though 1 he 1 was 1 full 1 of 1 entertaining 1 news, 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 come 1 down 1 to 1 impart 1 it, 1 in 1 case 1 he 1 got 1 hurt. 1 He 1 was 1 not 1 a 1 coward 1 and 1 bore 1 necessary 1 pain 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 any 1 man. 1 But 1 he 1 hated 1 the 1 physical 1 violence 1 of 1 the 1 young. 1 How 1 right 1 it 1 was! 1 Sure 1 enough 1 it 1 ended 1 in 1 a 1 cry. 1 \u201cI 1 wish 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 could 1 see 1 this,\u201d 1 observed 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 just 1 as 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 was 1 nursing 1 the 1 injured 1 Minnie, 1 was 1 in 1 turn 1 lifted 1 off 1 her 1 feet 1 by 1 her 1 brother. 1 \u201cWho 1 are 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans?\u201d 1 Freddy 1 panted. 1 \u201cThey 1 have 1 taken 1 Cissie 1 Villa.\u201d 1 \u201cThat 1 wasn\u2019t 1 the 1 name--\u201d 1 Here 1 his 1 foot 1 slipped, 1 and 1 they 1 all 1 fell 1 most 1 agreeably 1 on 1 to 1 the 1 grass. 1 An 1 interval 1 elapses. 1 \u201cWasn\u2019t 1 what 1 name?\u201d 1 asked 1 Lucy, 1 with 1 her 1 brother\u2019s 1 head 1 in 1 her 1 lap. 1 \u201cAlan 1 wasn\u2019t 1 the 1 name 1 of 1 the 1 people 1 Sir 1 Harry\u2019s 1 let 1 to.\u201d 1 \u201cNonsense, 1 Freddy! 1 You 1 know 1 nothing 1 about 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cNonsense 1 yourself! 1 I\u2019ve 1 this 1 minute 1 seen 1 him. 1 He 1 said 1 to 1 me: 1 \u2018Ahem! 1 Honeychurch,\u2019\u201d--Freddy 1 was 1 an 1 indifferent 1 mimic--\u201c\u2018ahem! 1 ahem! 1 I 1 have 1 at 1 last 1 procured 1 really 1 dee-sire-rebel 1 tenants.\u2019 1 I 1 said, 1 \u2018ooray, 1 old 1 boy!\u2019 1 and 1 slapped 1 him 1 on 1 the 1 back.\u201d 1 \u201cExactly. 1 The 1 Miss 1 Alans?\u201d 1 \u201cRather 1 not. 1 More 1 like 1 Anderson.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 good 1 gracious, 1 there 1 isn\u2019t 1 going 1 to 1 be 1 another 1 muddle!\u201d 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 exclaimed. 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 notice, 1 Lucy, 1 I\u2019m 1 always 1 right? 1 I 1 said 1 don\u2019t 1 interfere 1 with 1 Cissie 1 Villa. 1 I\u2019m 1 always 1 right. 1 I\u2019m 1 quite 1 uneasy 1 at 1 being 1 always 1 right 1 so 1 often.\u201d 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 only 1 another 1 muddle 1 of 1 Freddy\u2019s. 1 Freddy 1 doesn\u2019t 1 even 1 know 1 the 1 name 1 of 1 the 1 people 1 he 1 pretends 1 have 1 taken 1 it 1 instead.\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 I 1 do. 1 I\u2019ve 1 got 1 it. 1 Emerson.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 name?\u201d 1 \u201cEmerson. 1 I\u2019ll 1 bet 1 you 1 anything 1 you 1 like.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 a 1 weathercock 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 is,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 quietly. 1 \u201cI 1 wish 1 I 1 had 1 never 1 bothered 1 over 1 it 1 at 1 all.\u201d 1 Then 1 she 1 lay 1 on 1 her 1 back 1 and 1 gazed 1 at 1 the 1 cloudless 1 sky. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 whose 1 opinion 1 of 1 her 1 rose 1 daily, 1 whispered 1 to 1 his 1 niece 1 that 1 THAT 1 was 1 the 1 proper 1 way 1 to 1 behave 1 if 1 any 1 little 1 thing 1 went 1 wrong. 1 Meanwhile 1 the 1 name 1 of 1 the 1 new 1 tenants 1 had 1 diverted 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 from 1 the 1 contemplation 1 of 1 her 1 own 1 abilities. 1 \u201cEmerson, 1 Freddy? 1 Do 1 you 1 know 1 what 1 Emersons 1 they 1 are?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 whether 1 they\u2019re 1 any 1 Emersons,\u201d 1 retorted 1 Freddy, 1 who 1 was 1 democratic. 1 Like 1 his 1 sister 1 and 1 like 1 most 1 young 1 people, 1 he 1 was 1 naturally 1 attracted 1 by 1 the 1 idea 1 of 1 equality, 1 and 1 the 1 undeniable 1 fact 1 that 1 there 1 are 1 different 1 kinds 1 of 1 Emersons 1 annoyed 1 him 1 beyond 1 measure. 1 \u201cI 1 trust 1 they 1 are 1 the 1 right 1 sort 1 of 1 person. 1 All 1 right, 1 Lucy\u201d--she 1 was 1 sitting 1 up 1 again--\u201cI 1 see 1 you 1 looking 1 down 1 your 1 nose 1 and 1 thinking 1 your 1 mother\u2019s 1 a 1 snob. 1 But 1 there 1 is 1 a 1 right 1 sort 1 and 1 a 1 wrong 1 sort, 1 and 1 it\u2019s 1 affectation 1 to 1 pretend 1 there 1 isn\u2019t.\u201d 1 \u201cEmerson\u2019s 1 a 1 common 1 enough 1 name,\u201d 1 Lucy 1 remarked. 1 She 1 was 1 gazing 1 sideways. 1 Seated 1 on 1 a 1 promontory 1 herself, 1 she 1 could 1 see 1 the 1 pine-clad 1 promontories 1 descending 1 one 1 beyond 1 another 1 into 1 the 1 Weald. 1 The 1 further 1 one 1 descended 1 the 1 garden, 1 the 1 more 1 glorious 1 was 1 this 1 lateral 1 view. 1 \u201cI 1 was 1 merely 1 going 1 to 1 remark, 1 Freddy, 1 that 1 I 1 trusted 1 they 1 were 1 no 1 relations 1 of 1 Emerson 1 the 1 philosopher, 1 a 1 most 1 trying 1 man. 1 Pray, 1 does 1 that 1 satisfy 1 you?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 yes,\u201d 1 he 1 grumbled. 1 \u201cAnd 1 you 1 will 1 be 1 satisfied, 1 too, 1 for 1 they\u2019re 1 friends 1 of 1 Cecil; 1 so\u201d--elaborate 1 irony--\u201cyou 1 and 1 the 1 other 1 country 1 families 1 will 1 be 1 able 1 to 1 call 1 in 1 perfect 1 safety.\u201d 1 \u201cCECIL?\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 be 1 rude, 1 dear,\u201d 1 said 1 his 1 mother 1 placidly. 1 \u201cLucy, 1 don\u2019t 1 screech. 1 It\u2019s 1 a 1 new 1 bad 1 habit 1 you\u2019re 1 getting 1 into.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 has 1 Cecil--\u201d 1 \u201cFriends 1 of 1 Cecil\u2019s,\u201d 1 he 1 repeated, 1 \u201c\u2018and 1 so 1 really 1 dee-sire-rebel. 1 Ahem! 1 Honeychurch, 1 I 1 have 1 just 1 telegraphed 1 to 1 them.\u2019\u201d 1 She 1 got 1 up 1 from 1 the 1 grass. 1 It 1 was 1 hard 1 on 1 Lucy. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 sympathized 1 with 1 her 1 very 1 much. 1 While 1 she 1 believed 1 that 1 her 1 snub 1 about 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 came 1 from 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway, 1 she 1 had 1 borne 1 it 1 like 1 a 1 good 1 girl. 1 She 1 might 1 well 1 \u201cscreech\u201d 1 when 1 she 1 heard 1 that 1 it 1 came 1 partly 1 from 1 her 1 lover. 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 was 1 a 1 tease--something 1 worse 1 than 1 a 1 tease: 1 he 1 took 1 a 1 malicious 1 pleasure 1 in 1 thwarting 1 people. 1 The 1 clergyman, 1 knowing 1 this, 1 looked 1 at 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 with 1 more 1 than 1 his 1 usual 1 kindness. 1 When 1 she 1 exclaimed, 1 \u201cBut 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 Emersons--they 1 can\u2019t 1 possibly 1 be 1 the 1 same 1 ones--there 1 is 1 that--\u201d 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 consider 1 that 1 the 1 exclamation 1 was 1 strange, 1 but 1 saw 1 in 1 it 1 an 1 opportunity 1 of 1 diverting 1 the 1 conversation 1 while 1 she 1 recovered 1 her 1 composure. 1 He 1 diverted 1 it 1 as 1 follows: 1 \u201cThe 1 Emersons 1 who 1 were 1 at 1 Florence, 1 do 1 you 1 mean? 1 No, 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 suppose 1 it 1 will 1 prove 1 to 1 be 1 them. 1 It 1 is 1 probably 1 a 1 long 1 cry 1 from 1 them 1 to 1 friends 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Vyse\u2019s. 1 Oh, 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 the 1 oddest 1 people! 1 The 1 queerest 1 people! 1 For 1 our 1 part 1 we 1 liked 1 them, 1 didn\u2019t 1 we?\u201d 1 He 1 appealed 1 to 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cThere 1 was 1 a 1 great 1 scene 1 over 1 some 1 violets. 1 They 1 picked 1 violets 1 and 1 filled 1 all 1 the 1 vases 1 in 1 the 1 room 1 of 1 these 1 very 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 who 1 have 1 failed 1 to 1 come 1 to 1 Cissie 1 Villa. 1 Poor 1 little 1 ladies! 1 So 1 shocked 1 and 1 so 1 pleased. 1 It 1 used 1 to 1 be 1 one 1 of 1 Miss 1 Catharine\u2019s 1 great 1 stories. 1 \u2018My 1 dear 1 sister 1 loves 1 flowers,\u2019 1 it 1 began. 1 They 1 found 1 the 1 whole 1 room 1 a 1 mass 1 of 1 blue--vases 1 and 1 jugs--and 1 the 1 story 1 ends 1 with 1 \u2018So 1 ungentlemanly 1 and 1 yet 1 so 1 beautiful.\u2019 1 It 1 is 1 all 1 very 1 difficult. 1 Yes, 1 I 1 always 1 connect 1 those 1 Florentine 1 Emersons 1 with 1 violets.\u201d 1 \u201cFiasco\u2019s 1 done 1 you 1 this 1 time,\u201d 1 remarked 1 Freddy, 1 not 1 seeing 1 that 1 his 1 sister\u2019s 1 face 1 was 1 very 1 red. 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 always 1 felt 1 that 1 he 1 must 1 lead 1 women, 1 though 1 he 1 knew 1 not 1 whither, 1 and 1 protect 1 them, 1 though 1 he 1 knew 1 not 1 against 1 what. 1 He 1 led 1 them 1 now 1 towards 1 the 1 bracken 1 where 1 Freddy 1 sat 1 concealed. 1 \u201cOh, 1 poor 1 Mr. 1 Beebe! 1 Was 1 that 1 his 1 waistcoat 1 we 1 left 1 in 1 the 1 path? 1 Cecil, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 waistcoat--\u201d 1 \u201cNo 1 business 1 of 1 ours,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 glancing 1 at 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 was 1 all 1 parasol 1 and 1 evidently 1 \u2018minded.\u2019 1 \u201cI 1 fancy 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 jumped 1 back 1 into 1 the 1 pond.\u201d 1 \u201cThis 1 way, 1 please, 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 this 1 way.\u201d 1 They 1 followed 1 him 1 up 1 the 1 bank 1 attempting 1 the 1 tense 1 yet 1 nonchalant 1 expression 1 that 1 is 1 suitable 1 for 1 ladies 1 on 1 such 1 occasions. 1 \u201cWell, 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 help 1 it,\u201d 1 said 1 a 1 voice 1 close 1 ahead, 1 and 1 Freddy 1 reared 1 a 1 freckled 1 face 1 and 1 a 1 pair 1 of 1 snowy 1 shoulders 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 fronds. 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 be 1 trodden 1 on, 1 can 1 I?\u201d 1 \u201cGood 1 gracious 1 me, 1 dear; 1 so 1 it\u2019s 1 you! 1 What 1 miserable 1 management! 1 Why 1 not 1 have 1 a 1 comfortable 1 bath 1 at 1 home, 1 with 1 hot 1 and 1 cold 1 laid 1 on?\u201d 1 \u201cLook 1 here, 1 mother, 1 a 1 fellow 1 must 1 wash, 1 and 1 a 1 fellow\u2019s 1 got 1 to 1 dry, 1 and 1 if 1 another 1 fellow--\u201d 1 \u201cDear, 1 no 1 doubt 1 you\u2019re 1 right 1 as 1 usual, 1 but 1 you 1 are 1 in 1 no 1 position 1 to 1 argue. 1 Come, 1 Lucy.\u201d 1 They 1 turned. 1 \u201cOh, 1 look--don\u2019t 1 look! 1 Oh, 1 poor 1 Mr. 1 Beebe! 1 How 1 unfortunate 1 again--\u201d 1 For 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 just 1 crawling 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 pond, 1 on 1 whose 1 surface 1 garments 1 of 1 an 1 intimate 1 nature 1 did 1 float; 1 while 1 George, 1 the 1 world-weary 1 George, 1 shouted 1 to 1 Freddy 1 that 1 he 1 had 1 hooked 1 a 1 fish. 1 \u201cAnd 1 me, 1 I\u2019ve 1 swallowed 1 one,\u201d 1 answered 1 he 1 of 1 the 1 bracken. 1 \u201cI\u2019ve 1 swallowed 1 a 1 pollywog. 1 It 1 wriggleth 1 in 1 my 1 tummy. 1 I 1 shall 1 die--Emerson 1 you 1 beast, 1 you\u2019ve 1 got 1 on 1 my 1 bags.\u201d 1 \u201cHush, 1 dears,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 who 1 found 1 it 1 impossible 1 to 1 remain 1 shocked. 1 \u201cAnd 1 do 1 be 1 sure 1 you 1 dry 1 yourselves 1 thoroughly 1 first. 1 All 1 these 1 colds 1 come 1 of 1 not 1 drying 1 thoroughly.\u201d 1 \u201cMother, 1 do 1 come 1 away,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cOh 1 for 1 goodness\u2019 1 sake, 1 do 1 come.\u201d 1 \u201cHullo!\u201d 1 cried 1 George, 1 so 1 that 1 again 1 the 1 ladies 1 stopped. 1 He 1 regarded 1 himself 1 as 1 dressed. 1 Barefoot, 1 bare-chested, 1 radiant 1 and 1 personable 1 against 1 the 1 shadowy 1 woods, 1 he 1 called: 1 \u201cHullo, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch! 1 Hullo!\u201d 1 \u201cBow, 1 Lucy; 1 better 1 bow. 1 Whoever 1 is 1 it? 1 I 1 shall 1 bow.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 bowed. 1 That 1 evening 1 and 1 all 1 that 1 night 1 the 1 water 1 ran 1 away. 1 On 1 the 1 morrow 1 the 1 pool 1 had 1 shrunk 1 to 1 its 1 old 1 size 1 and 1 lost 1 its 1 glory. 1 It 1 had 1 been 1 a 1 call 1 to 1 the 1 blood 1 and 1 to 1 the 1 relaxed 1 will, 1 a 1 passing 1 benediction 1 whose 1 influence 1 did 1 not 1 pass, 1 a 1 holiness, 1 a 1 spell, 1 a 1 momentary 1 chalice 1 for 1 youth. 1 Chapter 1 XIII: 1 How 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 Boiler 1 Was 1 So 1 Tiresome 1 How 1 often 1 had 1 Lucy 1 rehearsed 1 this 1 bow, 1 this 1 interview! 1 But 1 she 1 had 1 always 1 rehearsed 1 them 1 indoors, 1 and 1 with 1 certain 1 accessories, 1 which 1 surely 1 we 1 have 1 a 1 right 1 to 1 assume. 1 Who 1 could 1 foretell 1 that 1 she 1 and 1 George 1 would 1 meet 1 in 1 the 1 rout 1 of 1 a 1 civilization, 1 amidst 1 an 1 army 1 of 1 coats 1 and 1 collars 1 and 1 boots 1 that 1 lay 1 wounded 1 over 1 the 1 sunlit 1 earth? 1 She 1 had 1 imagined 1 a 1 young 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 who 1 might 1 be 1 shy 1 or 1 morbid 1 or 1 indifferent 1 or 1 furtively 1 impudent. 1 She 1 was 1 prepared 1 for 1 all 1 of 1 these. 1 But 1 she 1 had 1 never 1 imagined 1 one 1 who 1 would 1 be 1 happy 1 and 1 greet 1 her 1 with 1 the 1 shout 1 of 1 the 1 morning 1 star. 1 Indoors 1 herself, 1 partaking 1 of 1 tea 1 with 1 old 1 Mrs. 1 Butterworth, 1 she 1 reflected 1 that 1 it 1 is 1 impossible 1 to 1 foretell 1 the 1 future 1 with 1 any 1 degree 1 of 1 accuracy, 1 that 1 it 1 is 1 impossible 1 to 1 rehearse 1 life. 1 A 1 fault 1 in 1 the 1 scenery, 1 a 1 face 1 in 1 the 1 audience, 1 an 1 irruption 1 of 1 the 1 audience 1 on 1 to 1 the 1 stage, 1 and 1 all 1 our 1 carefully 1 planned 1 gestures 1 mean 1 nothing, 1 or 1 mean 1 too 1 much. 1 \u201cI 1 will 1 bow,\u201d 1 she 1 had 1 thought. 1 \u201cI 1 will 1 not 1 shake 1 hands 1 with 1 him. 1 That 1 will 1 be 1 just 1 the 1 proper 1 thing.\u201d 1 She 1 had 1 bowed--but 1 to 1 whom? 1 To 1 gods, 1 to 1 heroes, 1 to 1 the 1 nonsense 1 of 1 school-girls! 1 She 1 had 1 bowed 1 across 1 the 1 rubbish 1 that 1 cumbers 1 the 1 world. 1 So 1 ran 1 her 1 thoughts, 1 while 1 her 1 faculties 1 were 1 busy 1 with 1 Cecil. 1 It 1 was 1 another 1 of 1 those 1 dreadful 1 engagement 1 calls. 1 Mrs. 1 Butterworth 1 had 1 wanted 1 to 1 see 1 him, 1 and 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 want 1 to 1 be 1 seen. 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 want 1 to 1 hear 1 about 1 hydrangeas, 1 why 1 they 1 change 1 their 1 colour 1 at 1 the 1 seaside. 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 want 1 to 1 join 1 the 1 C. 1 O. 1 S. 1 When 1 cross 1 he 1 was 1 always 1 elaborate, 1 and 1 made 1 long, 1 clever 1 answers 1 where 1 \u201cYes\u201d 1 or 1 \u201cNo\u201d 1 would 1 have 1 done. 1 Lucy 1 soothed 1 him 1 and 1 tinkered 1 at 1 the 1 conversation 1 in 1 a 1 way 1 that 1 promised 1 well 1 for 1 their 1 married 1 peace. 1 No 1 one 1 is 1 perfect, 1 and 1 surely 1 it 1 is 1 wiser 1 to 1 discover 1 the 1 imperfections 1 before 1 wedlock. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 indeed, 1 though 1 not 1 in 1 word, 1 had 1 taught 1 the 1 girl 1 that 1 this 1 our 1 life 1 contains 1 nothing 1 satisfactory. 1 Lucy, 1 though 1 she 1 disliked 1 the 1 teacher, 1 regarded 1 the 1 teaching 1 as 1 profound, 1 and 1 applied 1 it 1 to 1 her 1 lover. 1 \u201cLucy,\u201d 1 said 1 her 1 mother, 1 when 1 they 1 got 1 home, 1 \u201cis 1 anything 1 the 1 matter 1 with 1 Cecil?\u201d 1 The 1 question 1 was 1 ominous; 1 up 1 till 1 now 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 had 1 behaved 1 with 1 charity 1 and 1 restraint. 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 think 1 so, 1 mother; 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 all 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cPerhaps 1 he\u2019s 1 tired.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 compromised: 1 perhaps 1 Cecil 1 was 1 a 1 little 1 tired. 1 \u201cBecause 1 otherwise\u201d--she 1 pulled 1 out 1 her 1 bonnet-pins 1 with 1 gathering 1 displeasure--\u201cbecause 1 otherwise 1 I 1 cannot 1 account 1 for 1 him.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 do 1 think 1 Mrs. 1 Butterworth 1 is 1 rather 1 tiresome, 1 if 1 you 1 mean 1 that.\u201d 1 \u201cCecil 1 has 1 told 1 you 1 to 1 think 1 so. 1 You 1 were 1 devoted 1 to 1 her 1 as 1 a 1 little 1 girl, 1 and 1 nothing 1 will 1 describe 1 her 1 goodness 1 to 1 you 1 through 1 the 1 typhoid 1 fever. 1 No--it 1 is 1 just 1 the 1 same 1 thing 1 everywhere.\u201d 1 \u201cLet 1 me 1 just 1 put 1 your 1 bonnet 1 away, 1 may 1 I?\u201d 1 \u201cSurely 1 he 1 could 1 answer 1 her 1 civilly 1 for 1 one 1 half-hour?\u201d 1 \u201cCecil 1 has 1 a 1 very 1 high 1 standard 1 for 1 people,\u201d 1 faltered 1 Lucy, 1 seeing 1 trouble 1 ahead. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 part 1 of 1 his 1 ideals--it 1 is 1 really 1 that 1 that 1 makes 1 him 1 sometimes 1 seem--\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 rubbish! 1 If 1 high 1 ideals 1 make 1 a 1 young 1 man 1 rude, 1 the 1 sooner 1 he 1 gets 1 rid 1 of 1 them 1 the 1 better,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 handing 1 her 1 the 1 bonnet. 1 \u201cNow, 1 mother! 1 I\u2019ve 1 seen 1 you 1 cross 1 with 1 Mrs. 1 Butterworth 1 yourself!\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 in 1 that 1 way. 1 At 1 times 1 I 1 could 1 wring 1 her 1 neck. 1 But 1 not 1 in 1 that 1 way. 1 No. 1 It 1 is 1 the 1 same 1 with 1 Cecil 1 all 1 over.\u201d 1 \u201cBy-the-by--I 1 never 1 told 1 you. 1 I 1 had 1 a 1 letter 1 from 1 Charlotte 1 while 1 I 1 was 1 away 1 in 1 London.\u201d 1 This 1 attempt 1 to 1 divert 1 the 1 conversation 1 was 1 too 1 puerile, 1 and 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 resented 1 it. 1 \u201cSince 1 Cecil 1 came 1 back 1 from 1 London, 1 nothing 1 appears 1 to 1 please 1 him. 1 Whenever 1 I 1 speak 1 he 1 winces;--I 1 see 1 him, 1 Lucy; 1 it 1 is 1 useless 1 to 1 contradict 1 me. 1 No 1 doubt 1 I 1 am 1 neither 1 artistic 1 nor 1 literary 1 nor 1 intellectual 1 nor 1 musical, 1 but 1 I 1 cannot 1 help 1 the 1 drawing-room 1 furniture; 1 your 1 father 1 bought 1 it 1 and 1 we 1 must 1 put 1 up 1 with 1 it, 1 will 1 Cecil 1 kindly 1 remember.\u201d 1 \u201cI--I 1 see 1 what 1 you 1 mean, 1 and 1 certainly 1 Cecil 1 oughtn\u2019t 1 to. 1 But 1 he 1 does 1 not 1 mean 1 to 1 be 1 uncivil--he 1 once 1 explained--it 1 is 1 the 1 things 1 that 1 upset 1 him--he 1 is 1 easily 1 upset 1 by 1 ugly 1 things--he 1 is 1 not 1 uncivil 1 to 1 PEOPLE.\u201d 1 \u201cIs 1 it 1 a 1 thing 1 or 1 a 1 person 1 when 1 Freddy 1 sings?\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 can\u2019t 1 expect 1 a 1 really 1 musical 1 person 1 to 1 enjoy 1 comic 1 songs 1 as 1 we 1 do.\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 why 1 didn\u2019t 1 he 1 leave 1 the 1 room? 1 Why 1 sit 1 wriggling 1 and 1 sneering 1 and 1 spoiling 1 everyone\u2019s 1 pleasure?\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 mustn\u2019t 1 be 1 unjust 1 to 1 people,\u201d 1 faltered 1 Lucy. 1 Something 1 had 1 enfeebled 1 her, 1 and 1 the 1 case 1 for 1 Cecil, 1 which 1 she 1 had 1 mastered 1 so 1 perfectly 1 in 1 London, 1 would 1 not 1 come 1 forth 1 in 1 an 1 effective 1 form. 1 The 1 two 1 civilizations 1 had 1 clashed--Cecil 1 hinted 1 that 1 they 1 might--and 1 she 1 was 1 dazzled 1 and 1 bewildered, 1 as 1 though 1 the 1 radiance 1 that 1 lies 1 behind 1 all 1 civilization 1 had 1 blinded 1 her 1 eyes. 1 Good 1 taste 1 and 1 bad 1 taste 1 were 1 only 1 catchwords, 1 garments 1 of 1 diverse 1 cut; 1 and 1 music 1 itself 1 dissolved 1 to 1 a 1 whisper 1 through 1 pine-trees, 1 where 1 the 1 song 1 is 1 not 1 distinguishable 1 from 1 the 1 comic 1 song. 1 She 1 remained 1 in 1 much 1 embarrassment, 1 while 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 changed 1 her 1 frock 1 for 1 dinner; 1 and 1 every 1 now 1 and 1 then 1 she 1 said 1 a 1 word, 1 and 1 made 1 things 1 no 1 better. 1 There 1 was 1 no 1 concealing 1 the 1 fact, 1 Cecil 1 had 1 meant 1 to 1 be 1 supercilious, 1 and 1 he 1 had 1 succeeded. 1 And 1 Lucy--she 1 knew 1 not 1 why--wished 1 that 1 the 1 trouble 1 could 1 have 1 come 1 at 1 any 1 other 1 time. 1 \u201cGo 1 and 1 dress, 1 dear; 1 you\u2019ll 1 be 1 late.\u201d 1 \u201cAll 1 right, 1 mother--\u201d 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 say 1 \u2018All 1 right\u2019 1 and 1 stop. 1 Go.\u201d 1 She 1 obeyed, 1 but 1 loitered 1 disconsolately 1 at 1 the 1 landing 1 window. 1 It 1 faced 1 north, 1 so 1 there 1 was 1 little 1 view, 1 and 1 no 1 view 1 of 1 the 1 sky. 1 Now, 1 as 1 in 1 the 1 winter, 1 the 1 pine-trees 1 hung 1 close 1 to 1 her 1 eyes. 1 One 1 connected 1 the 1 landing 1 window 1 with 1 depression. 1 No 1 definite 1 problem 1 menaced 1 her, 1 but 1 she 1 sighed 1 to 1 herself, 1 \u201cOh, 1 dear, 1 what 1 shall 1 I 1 do, 1 what 1 shall 1 I 1 do?\u201d 1 It 1 seemed 1 to 1 her 1 that 1 everyone 1 else 1 was 1 behaving 1 very 1 badly. 1 And 1 she 1 ought 1 not 1 to 1 have 1 mentioned 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 letter. 1 She 1 must 1 be 1 more 1 careful; 1 her 1 mother 1 was 1 rather 1 inquisitive, 1 and 1 might 1 have 1 asked 1 what 1 it 1 was 1 about. 1 Oh, 1 dear, 1 what 1 should 1 she 1 do?--and 1 then 1 Freddy 1 came 1 bounding 1 upstairs, 1 and 1 joined 1 the 1 ranks 1 of 1 the 1 ill-behaved. 1 \u201cI 1 say, 1 those 1 are 1 topping 1 people.\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 dear 1 baby, 1 how 1 tiresome 1 you\u2019ve 1 been! 1 You 1 have 1 no 1 business 1 to 1 take 1 them 1 bathing 1 in 1 the 1 Sacred 1 Lake; 1 it\u2019s 1 much 1 too 1 public. 1 It 1 was 1 all 1 right 1 for 1 you 1 but 1 most 1 awkward 1 for 1 everyone 1 else. 1 Do 1 be 1 more 1 careful. 1 You 1 forget 1 the 1 place 1 is 1 growing 1 half 1 suburban.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 say, 1 is 1 anything 1 on 1 to-morrow 1 week?\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 that 1 I 1 know 1 of.\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 ask 1 the 1 Emersons 1 up 1 to 1 Sunday 1 tennis.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 I 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 do 1 that, 1 Freddy, 1 I 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 do 1 that 1 with 1 all 1 this 1 muddle.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat\u2019s 1 wrong 1 with 1 the 1 court? 1 They 1 won\u2019t 1 mind 1 a 1 bump 1 or 1 two, 1 and 1 I\u2019ve 1 ordered 1 new 1 balls.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 meant 1 it\u2019s 1 better 1 not. 1 I 1 really 1 mean 1 it.\u201d 1 He 1 seized 1 her 1 by 1 the 1 elbows 1 and 1 humorously 1 danced 1 her 1 up 1 and 1 down 1 the 1 passage. 1 She 1 pretended 1 not 1 to 1 mind, 1 but 1 she 1 could 1 have 1 screamed 1 with 1 temper. 1 Cecil 1 glanced 1 at 1 them 1 as 1 he 1 proceeded 1 to 1 his 1 toilet 1 and 1 they 1 impeded 1 Mary 1 with 1 her 1 brood 1 of 1 hot-water 1 cans. 1 Then 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 opened 1 her 1 door 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cLucy, 1 what 1 a 1 noise 1 you\u2019re 1 making! 1 I 1 have 1 something 1 to 1 say 1 to 1 you. 1 Did 1 you 1 say 1 you 1 had 1 had 1 a 1 letter 1 from 1 Charlotte?\u201d 1 and 1 Freddy 1 ran 1 away. 1 \u201cYes. 1 I 1 really 1 can\u2019t 1 stop. 1 I 1 must 1 dress 1 too.\u201d 1 \u201cHow\u2019s 1 Charlotte?\u201d 1 \u201cAll 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cLucy!\u201d 1 The 1 unfortunate 1 girl 1 returned. 1 \u201cYou\u2019ve 1 a 1 bad 1 habit 1 of 1 hurrying 1 away 1 in 1 the 1 middle 1 of 1 one\u2019s 1 sentences. 1 Did 1 Charlotte 1 mention 1 her 1 boiler?\u201d 1 \u201cHer 1 WHAT?\u201d 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 me 1 when 1 I 1 had 1 gone.\u201d 1 She 1 raised 1 her 1 hand 1 to 1 her 1 cheek. 1 \u201cHe 1 does 1 not 1 love 1 me. 1 No. 1 How 1 terrible 1 if 1 he 1 did! 1 But 1 he 1 has 1 not 1 told. 1 He 1 will 1 not 1 tell.\u201d 1 She 1 longed 1 to 1 shout 1 the 1 words: 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 all 1 right. 1 It\u2019s 1 a 1 secret 1 between 1 us 1 two 1 for 1 ever. 1 Cecil 1 will 1 never 1 hear.\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 even 1 glad 1 that 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 made 1 her 1 promise 1 secrecy, 1 that 1 last 1 dark 1 evening 1 at 1 Florence, 1 when 1 they 1 had 1 knelt 1 packing 1 in 1 his 1 room. 1 The 1 secret, 1 big 1 or 1 little, 1 was 1 guarded. 1 Only 1 three 1 English 1 people 1 knew 1 of 1 it 1 in 1 the 1 world. 1 Thus 1 she 1 interpreted 1 her 1 joy. 1 She 1 greeted 1 Cecil 1 with 1 unusual 1 radiance, 1 because 1 she 1 felt 1 so 1 safe. 1 As 1 he 1 helped 1 her 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 carriage, 1 she 1 said: 1 \u201cThe 1 Emersons 1 have 1 been 1 so 1 nice. 1 George 1 Emerson 1 has 1 improved 1 enormously.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 are 1 my 1 proteges?\u201d 1 asked 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 took 1 no 1 real 1 interest 1 in 1 them, 1 and 1 had 1 long 1 since 1 forgotten 1 his 1 resolution 1 to 1 bring 1 them 1 to 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 for 1 educational 1 purposes. 1 \u201cProteges!\u201d 1 she 1 exclaimed 1 with 1 some 1 warmth. 1 For 1 the 1 only 1 relationship 1 which 1 Cecil 1 conceived 1 was 1 feudal: 1 that 1 of 1 protector 1 and 1 protected. 1 He 1 had 1 no 1 glimpse 1 of 1 the 1 comradeship 1 after 1 which 1 the 1 girl\u2019s 1 soul 1 yearned. 1 \u201cYou 1 shall 1 see 1 for 1 yourself 1 how 1 your 1 proteges 1 are. 1 George 1 Emerson 1 is 1 coming 1 up 1 this 1 afternoon. 1 He 1 is 1 a 1 most 1 interesting 1 man 1 to 1 talk 1 to. 1 Only 1 don\u2019t--\u201d 1 She 1 nearly 1 said, 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 protect 1 him.\u201d 1 But 1 the 1 bell 1 was 1 ringing 1 for 1 lunch, 1 and, 1 as 1 often 1 happened, 1 Cecil 1 had 1 paid 1 no 1 great 1 attention 1 to 1 her 1 remarks. 1 Charm, 1 not 1 argument, 1 was 1 to 1 be 1 her 1 forte. 1 Lunch 1 was 1 a 1 cheerful 1 meal. 1 Generally 1 Lucy 1 was 1 depressed 1 at 1 meals. 1 Some 1 one 1 had 1 to 1 be 1 soothed--either 1 Cecil 1 or 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 or 1 a 1 Being 1 not 1 visible 1 to 1 the 1 mortal 1 eye--a 1 Being 1 who 1 whispered 1 to 1 her 1 soul: 1 \u201cIt 1 will 1 not 1 last, 1 this 1 cheerfulness. 1 In 1 January 1 you 1 must 1 go 1 to 1 London 1 to 1 entertain 1 the 1 grandchildren 1 of 1 celebrated 1 men.\u201d 1 But 1 to-day 1 she 1 felt 1 she 1 had 1 received 1 a 1 guarantee. 1 Her 1 mother 1 would 1 always 1 sit 1 there, 1 her 1 brother 1 here. 1 The 1 sun, 1 though 1 it 1 had 1 moved 1 a 1 little 1 since 1 the 1 morning, 1 would 1 never 1 be 1 hidden 1 behind 1 the 1 western 1 hills. 1 After 1 luncheon 1 they 1 asked 1 her 1 to 1 play. 1 She 1 had 1 seen 1 Gluck\u2019s 1 Armide 1 that 1 year, 1 and 1 played 1 from 1 memory 1 the 1 music 1 of 1 the 1 enchanted 1 garden--the 1 music 1 to 1 which 1 Renaud 1 approaches, 1 beneath 1 the 1 light 1 of 1 an 1 eternal 1 dawn, 1 the 1 music 1 that 1 never 1 gains, 1 never 1 wanes, 1 but 1 ripples 1 for 1 ever 1 like 1 the 1 tideless 1 seas 1 of 1 fairyland. 1 Such 1 music 1 is 1 not 1 for 1 the 1 piano, 1 and 1 her 1 audience 1 began 1 to 1 get 1 restive, 1 and 1 Cecil, 1 sharing 1 the 1 discontent, 1 called 1 out: 1 \u201cNow 1 play 1 us 1 the 1 other 1 garden--the 1 one 1 in 1 Parsifal.\u201d 1 She 1 closed 1 the 1 instrument. 1 \u201cNot 1 very 1 dutiful,\u201d 1 said 1 her 1 mother\u2019s 1 voice. 1 Fearing 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 offended 1 Cecil, 1 she 1 turned 1 quickly 1 round. 1 There 1 George 1 was. 1 He 1 had 1 crept 1 in 1 without 1 interrupting 1 her. 1 \u201cOh, 1 I 1 had 1 no 1 idea!\u201d 1 she 1 exclaimed, 1 getting 1 very 1 red; 1 and 1 then, 1 without 1 a 1 word 1 of 1 greeting, 1 she 1 reopened 1 the 1 piano. 1 Cecil 1 should 1 have 1 the 1 Parsifal, 1 and 1 anything 1 else 1 that 1 he 1 liked. 1 \u201cOur 1 performer 1 has 1 changed 1 her 1 mind,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 perhaps 1 implying, 1 she 1 will 1 play 1 the 1 music 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 Lucy 1 did 1 not 1 know 1 what 1 to 1 do 1 nor 1 even 1 what 1 she 1 wanted 1 to 1 do. 1 She 1 played 1 a 1 few 1 bars 1 of 1 the 1 Flower 1 Maidens\u2019 1 song 1 very 1 badly 1 and 1 then 1 she 1 stopped. 1 \u201cI 1 vote 1 tennis,\u201d 1 said 1 Freddy, 1 disgusted 1 at 1 the 1 scrappy 1 entertainment. 1 \u201cYes, 1 so 1 do 1 I.\u201d 1 Once 1 more 1 she 1 closed 1 the 1 unfortunate 1 piano. 1 \u201cI 1 vote 1 you 1 have 1 a 1 men\u2019s 1 four.\u201d 1 \u201cAll 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 for 1 me, 1 thank 1 you,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cI 1 will 1 not 1 spoil 1 the 1 set.\u201d 1 He 1 never 1 realized 1 that 1 it 1 may 1 be 1 an 1 act 1 of 1 kindness 1 in 1 a 1 bad 1 player 1 to 1 make 1 up 1 a 1 fourth. 1 \u201cOh, 1 come 1 along 1 Cecil. 1 I\u2019m 1 bad, 1 Floyd\u2019s 1 rotten, 1 and 1 so 1 I 1 dare 1 say\u2019s 1 Emerson.\u201d 1 George 1 corrected 1 him: 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 not 1 bad.\u201d 1 One 1 looked 1 down 1 one\u2019s 1 nose 1 at 1 this. 1 \u201cThen 1 certainly 1 I 1 won\u2019t 1 play,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 while 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 under 1 the 1 impression 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 snubbing 1 George, 1 added: 1 \u201cI 1 agree 1 with 1 you, 1 Mr. 1 Vyse. 1 You 1 had 1 much 1 better 1 not 1 play. 1 Much 1 better 1 not.\u201d 1 Minnie, 1 rushing 1 in 1 where 1 Cecil 1 feared 1 to 1 tread, 1 announced 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 play. 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 miss 1 every 1 ball 1 anyway, 1 so 1 what 1 does 1 it 1 matter?\u201d 1 But 1 Sunday 1 intervened 1 and 1 stamped 1 heavily 1 upon 1 the 1 kindly 1 suggestion. 1 \u201cThen 1 it 1 will 1 have 1 to 1 be 1 Lucy,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch; 1 \u201cyou 1 must 1 fall 1 back 1 on 1 Lucy. 1 There 1 is 1 no 1 other 1 way 1 out 1 of 1 it. 1 Lucy, 1 go 1 and 1 change 1 your 1 frock.\u201d 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 Sabbath 1 was 1 generally 1 of 1 this 1 amphibious 1 nature. 1 She 1 kept 1 it 1 without 1 hypocrisy 1 in 1 the 1 morning, 1 and 1 broke 1 it 1 without 1 reluctance 1 in 1 the 1 afternoon. 1 As 1 she 1 changed 1 her 1 frock, 1 she 1 wondered 1 whether 1 Cecil 1 was 1 sneering 1 at 1 her; 1 really 1 she 1 must 1 overhaul 1 herself 1 and 1 settle 1 everything 1 up 1 before 1 she 1 married 1 him. 1 Mr. 1 Floyd 1 was 1 her 1 partner. 1 She 1 liked 1 music, 1 but 1 how 1 much 1 better 1 tennis 1 seemed. 1 How 1 much 1 better 1 to 1 run 1 about 1 in 1 comfortable 1 clothes 1 than 1 to 1 sit 1 at 1 the 1 piano 1 and 1 feel 1 girt 1 under 1 the 1 arms. 1 Once 1 more 1 music 1 appeared 1 to 1 her 1 the 1 employment 1 of 1 a 1 child. 1 George 1 served, 1 and 1 surprised 1 her 1 by 1 his 1 anxiety 1 to 1 win. 1 She 1 remembered 1 how 1 he 1 had 1 sighed 1 among 1 the 1 tombs 1 at 1 Santa 1 Croce 1 because 1 things 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 fit; 1 how 1 after 1 the 1 death 1 of 1 that 1 obscure 1 Italian 1 he 1 had 1 leant 1 over 1 the 1 parapet 1 by 1 the 1 Arno 1 and 1 said 1 to 1 her: 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 want 1 to 1 live, 1 I 1 tell 1 you.\u201d 1 He 1 wanted 1 to 1 live 1 now, 1 to 1 win 1 at 1 tennis, 1 to 1 stand 1 for 1 all 1 he 1 was 1 worth 1 in 1 the 1 sun--the 1 sun 1 which 1 had 1 begun 1 to 1 decline 1 and 1 was 1 shining 1 in 1 her 1 eyes; 1 and 1 he 1 did 1 win. 1 Ah, 1 how 1 beautiful 1 the 1 Weald 1 looked! 1 The 1 hills 1 stood 1 out 1 above 1 its 1 radiance, 1 as 1 Fiesole 1 stands 1 above 1 the 1 Tuscan 1 Plain, 1 and 1 the 1 South 1 Downs, 1 if 1 one 1 chose, 1 were 1 the 1 mountains 1 of 1 Carrara. 1 She 1 might 1 be 1 forgetting 1 her 1 Italy, 1 but 1 she 1 was 1 noticing 1 more 1 things 1 in 1 her 1 England. 1 One 1 could 1 play 1 a 1 new 1 game 1 with 1 the 1 view, 1 and 1 try 1 to 1 find 1 in 1 its 1 innumerable 1 folds 1 some 1 town 1 or 1 village 1 that 1 would 1 do 1 for 1 Florence. 1 Ah, 1 how 1 beautiful 1 the 1 Weald 1 looked! 1 But 1 now 1 Cecil 1 claimed 1 her. 1 He 1 chanced 1 to 1 be 1 in 1 a 1 lucid 1 critical 1 mood, 1 and 1 would 1 not 1 sympathize 1 with 1 exaltation. 1 He 1 had 1 been 1 rather 1 a 1 nuisance 1 all 1 through 1 the 1 tennis, 1 for 1 the 1 novel 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 reading 1 was 1 so 1 bad 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 obliged 1 to 1 read 1 it 1 aloud 1 to 1 others. 1 He 1 would 1 stroll 1 round 1 the 1 precincts 1 of 1 the 1 court 1 and 1 call 1 out: 1 \u201cI 1 say, 1 listen 1 to 1 this, 1 Lucy. 1 Three 1 split 1 infinitives.\u201d 1 \u201cDreadful!\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 missed 1 her 1 stroke. 1 When 1 they 1 had 1 finished 1 their 1 set, 1 he 1 still 1 went 1 on 1 reading; 1 there 1 was 1 some 1 murder 1 scene, 1 and 1 really 1 everyone 1 must 1 listen 1 to 1 it. 1 Freddy 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Floyd 1 were 1 obliged 1 to 1 hunt 1 for 1 a 1 lost 1 ball 1 in 1 the 1 laurels, 1 but 1 the 1 other 1 two 1 acquiesced. 1 \u201cThe 1 scene 1 is 1 laid 1 in 1 Florence.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 fun, 1 Cecil! 1 Read 1 away. 1 Come, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 sit 1 down 1 after 1 all 1 your 1 energy.\u201d 1 She 1 had 1 \u201cforgiven\u201d 1 George, 1 as 1 she 1 put 1 it, 1 and 1 she 1 made 1 a 1 point 1 of 1 being 1 pleasant 1 to 1 him. 1 He 1 jumped 1 over 1 the 1 net 1 and 1 sat 1 down 1 at 1 her 1 feet 1 asking: 1 \u201cYou--and 1 are 1 you 1 tired?\u201d 1 \u201cOf 1 course 1 I\u2019m 1 not!\u201d 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 mind 1 being 1 beaten?\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 going 1 to 1 answer, 1 \u201cNo,\u201d 1 when 1 it 1 struck 1 her 1 that 1 she 1 did 1 mind, 1 so 1 she 1 answered, 1 \u201cYes.\u201d 1 She 1 added 1 merrily, 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 you\u2019re 1 such 1 a 1 splendid 1 player, 1 though. 1 The 1 light 1 was 1 behind 1 you, 1 and 1 it 1 was 1 in 1 my 1 eyes.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 never 1 said 1 I 1 was.\u201d 1 \u201cWhy, 1 you 1 did!\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 didn\u2019t 1 attend.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 said--oh, 1 don\u2019t 1 go 1 in 1 for 1 accuracy 1 at 1 this 1 house. 1 We 1 all 1 exaggerate, 1 and 1 we 1 get 1 very 1 angry 1 with 1 people 1 who 1 don\u2019t.\u201d 1 \u201c\u2018The 1 scene 1 is 1 laid 1 in 1 Florence,\u2019\u201d 1 repeated 1 Cecil, 1 with 1 an 1 upward 1 note. 1 Lucy 1 recollected 1 herself. 1 \u201c\u2018Sunset. 1 Leonora 1 was 1 speeding--\u2019\u201d 1 Lucy 1 interrupted. 1 \u201cLeonora? 1 Is 1 Leonora 1 the 1 heroine? 1 Who\u2019s 1 the 1 book 1 by?\u201d 1 \u201cJoseph 1 Emery 1 Prank. 1 \u2018Sunset. 1 Leonora 1 speeding 1 across 1 the 1 square. 1 Pray 1 the 1 saints 1 she 1 might 1 not 1 arrive 1 too 1 late. 1 Sunset--the 1 sunset 1 of 1 Italy. 1 Under 1 Orcagna\u2019s 1 Loggia--the 1 Loggia 1 de\u2019 1 Lanzi, 1 as 1 we 1 sometimes 1 call 1 it 1 now--\u2019\u201d 1 Lucy 1 burst 1 into 1 laughter. 1 \u201c\u2018Joseph 1 Emery 1 Prank\u2019 1 indeed! 1 Why 1 it\u2019s 1 Miss 1 Lavish! 1 It\u2019s 1 Miss 1 Lavish\u2019s 1 novel, 1 and 1 she\u2019s 1 publishing 1 it 1 under 1 somebody 1 else\u2019s 1 name.\u201d 1 \u201cWho 1 may 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 be?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 a 1 dreadful 1 person--Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 you 1 remember 1 Miss 1 Lavish?\u201d 1 Excited 1 by 1 her 1 pleasant 1 afternoon, 1 she 1 clapped 1 her 1 hands. 1 George 1 looked 1 up. 1 \u201cOf 1 course 1 I 1 do. 1 I 1 saw 1 her 1 the 1 day 1 I 1 arrived 1 at 1 Summer 1 Street. 1 It 1 was 1 she 1 who 1 told 1 me 1 that 1 you 1 lived 1 here.\u201d 1 \u201cWeren\u2019t 1 you 1 pleased?\u201d 1 She 1 meant 1 \u201cto 1 see 1 Miss 1 Lavish,\u201d 1 but 1 when 1 he 1 bent 1 down 1 to 1 the 1 grass 1 without 1 replying, 1 it 1 struck 1 her 1 that 1 she 1 could 1 mean 1 something 1 else. 1 She 1 watched 1 his 1 head, 1 which 1 was 1 almost 1 resting 1 against 1 her 1 knee, 1 and 1 she 1 thought 1 that 1 the 1 ears 1 were 1 reddening. 1 \u201cNo 1 wonder 1 the 1 novel\u2019s 1 bad,\u201d 1 she

1 words. 1 I 1 love 1 it; 1 I 1 revel 1 in 1 shaking 1 off 1 the 1 trammels 1 of 1 respectability, 1 as 1 you 1 know.\u201d 1 The 1 young 1 man 1 named 1 George 1 glanced 1 at 1 the 1 clever 1 lady, 1 and 1 then 1 returned 1 moodily 1 to 1 his 1 plate. 1 Obviously 1 he 1 and 1 his 1 father 1 did 1 not 1 do. 1 Lucy, 1 in 1 the 1 midst 1 of 1 her 1 success, 1 found 1 time 1 to 1 wish 1 they 1 did. 1 It 1 gave 1 her 1 no 1 extra 1 pleasure 1 that 1 any 1 one 1 should 1 be 1 left 1 in 1 the 1 cold; 1 and 1 when 1 she 1 rose 1 to 1 go, 1 she 1 turned 1 back 1 and 1 gave 1 the 1 two 1 outsiders 1 a 1 nervous 1 little 1 bow. 1 The 1 father 1 did 1 not 1 see 1 it; 1 the 1 son 1 acknowledged 1 it, 1 not 1 by 1 another 1 bow, 1 but 1 by 1 raising 1 his 1 eyebrows 1 and 1 smiling; 1 he 1 seemed 1 to 1 be 1 smiling 1 across 1 something. 1 She 1 hastened 1 after 1 her 1 cousin, 1 who 1 had 1 already 1 disappeared 1 through 1 the 1 curtains--curtains 1 which 1 smote 1 one 1 in 1 the 1 face, 1 and 1 seemed 1 heavy 1 with 1 more 1 than 1 cloth. 1 Beyond 1 them 1 stood 1 the 1 unreliable 1 Signora, 1 bowing 1 good-evening 1 to 1 her 1 guests, 1 and 1 supported 1 by 1 \u2018Enery, 1 her 1 little 1 boy, 1 and 1 Victorier, 1 her 1 daughter. 1 It 1 made 1 a 1 curious 1 little 1 scene, 1 this 1 attempt 1 of 1 the 1 Cockney 1 to 1 convey 1 the 1 grace 1 and 1 geniality 1 of 1 the 1 South. 1 And 1 even 1 more 1 curious 1 was 1 the 1 drawing-room, 1 which 1 attempted 1 to 1 rival 1 the 1 solid 1 comfort 1 of 1 a 1 Bloomsbury 1 boarding-house. 1 Was 1 this 1 really 1 Italy? 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 already 1 seated 1 on 1 a 1 tightly 1 stuffed 1 arm-chair, 1 which 1 had 1 the 1 colour 1 and 1 the 1 contours 1 of 1 a 1 tomato. 1 She 1 was 1 talking 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 and 1 as 1 she 1 spoke, 1 her 1 long 1 narrow 1 head 1 drove 1 backwards 1 and 1 forwards, 1 slowly, 1 regularly, 1 as 1 though 1 she 1 were 1 demolishing 1 some 1 invisible 1 obstacle. 1 \u201cWe 1 are 1 most 1 grateful 1 to 1 you,\u201d 1 she 1 was 1 saying. 1 \u201cThe 1 first 1 evening 1 means 1 so 1 much. 1 When 1 you 1 arrived 1 we 1 were 1 in 1 for 1 a 1 peculiarly 1 mauvais 1 quart 1 d\u2019heure.\u201d 1 He 1 expressed 1 his 1 regret. 1 \u201cDo 1 you, 1 by 1 any 1 chance, 1 know 1 the 1 name 1 of 1 an 1 old 1 man 1 who 1 sat 1 opposite 1 us 1 at 1 dinner?\u201d 1 \u201cEmerson.\u201d 1 \u201cIs 1 he 1 a 1 friend 1 of 1 yours?\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 are 1 friendly--as 1 one 1 is 1 in 1 pensions.\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 I 1 will 1 say 1 no 1 more.\u201d 1 He 1 pressed 1 her 1 very 1 slightly, 1 and 1 she 1 said 1 more. 1 \u201cI 1 am, 1 as 1 it 1 were,\u201d 1 she 1 concluded, 1 \u201cthe 1 chaperon 1 of 1 my 1 young 1 cousin, 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 it 1 would 1 be 1 a 1 serious 1 thing 1 if 1 I 1 put 1 her 1 under 1 an 1 obligation 1 to 1 people 1 of 1 whom 1 we 1 know 1 nothing. 1 His 1 manner 1 was 1 somewhat 1 unfortunate. 1 I 1 hope 1 I 1 acted 1 for 1 the 1 best.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 acted 1 very 1 naturally,\u201d 1 said 1 he. 1 He 1 seemed 1 thoughtful, 1 and 1 after 1 a 1 few 1 moments 1 added: 1 \u201cAll 1 the 1 same, 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 think 1 much 1 harm 1 would 1 have 1 come 1 of 1 accepting.\u201d 1 \u201cNo 1 harm, 1 of 1 course. 1 But 1 we 1 could 1 not 1 be 1 under 1 an 1 obligation.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 rather 1 a 1 peculiar 1 man.\u201d 1 Again 1 he 1 hesitated, 1 and 1 then 1 said 1 gently: 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 he 1 would 1 not 1 take 1 advantage 1 of 1 your 1 acceptance, 1 nor 1 expect 1 you 1 to 1 show 1 gratitude. 1 He 1 has 1 the 1 merit--if 1 it 1 is 1 one--of 1 saying 1 exactly 1 what 1 he 1 means. 1 He 1 has 1 rooms 1 he 1 does 1 not 1 value, 1 and 1 he 1 thinks 1 you 1 would 1 value 1 them. 1 He 1 no 1 more 1 thought 1 of 1 putting 1 you 1 under 1 an 1 obligation 1 than 1 he 1 thought 1 of 1 being 1 polite. 1 It 1 is 1 so 1 difficult--at 1 least, 1 I 1 find 1 it 1 difficult--to 1 understand 1 people 1 who 1 speak 1 the 1 truth.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 was 1 pleased, 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cI 1 was 1 hoping 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 nice; 1 I 1 do 1 so 1 always 1 hope 1 that 1 people 1 will 1 be 1 nice.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 he 1 is; 1 nice 1 and 1 tiresome. 1 I 1 differ 1 from 1 him 1 on 1 almost 1 every 1 point 1 of 1 any 1 importance, 1 and 1 so, 1 I 1 expect--I 1 may 1 say 1 I 1 hope--you 1 will 1 differ. 1 But 1 his 1 is 1 a 1 type 1 one 1 disagrees 1 with 1 rather 1 than 1 deplores. 1 When 1 he 1 first 1 came 1 here 1 he 1 not 1 unnaturally 1 put 1 people\u2019s 1 backs 1 up. 1 He 1 has 1 no 1 tact 1 and 1 no 1 manners--I 1 don\u2019t 1 mean 1 by 1 that 1 that 1 he 1 has 1 bad 1 manners--and 1 he 1 will 1 not 1 keep 1 his 1 opinions 1 to 1 himself. 1 We 1 nearly 1 complained 1 about 1 him 1 to 1 our 1 depressing 1 Signora, 1 but 1 I 1 am 1 glad 1 to 1 say 1 we 1 thought 1 better 1 of 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cAm 1 I 1 to 1 conclude,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 \u201cthat 1 he 1 is 1 a 1 Socialist?\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 accepted 1 the 1 convenient 1 word, 1 not 1 without 1 a 1 slight 1 twitching 1 of 1 the 1 lips. 1 \u201cAnd 1 presumably 1 he 1 has 1 brought 1 up 1 his 1 son 1 to 1 be 1 a 1 Socialist, 1 too?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 hardly 1 know 1 George, 1 for 1 he 1 hasn\u2019t 1 learnt 1 to 1 talk 1 yet. 1 He 1 seems 1 a 1 nice 1 creature, 1 and 1 I 1 think 1 he 1 has 1 brains. 1 Of 1 course, 1 he 1 has 1 all 1 his 1 father\u2019s 1 mannerisms, 1 and 1 it 1 is 1 quite 1 possible 1 that 1 he, 1 too, 1 may 1 be 1 a 1 Socialist.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 you 1 relieve 1 me,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cSo 1 you 1 think 1 I 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 accepted 1 their 1 offer? 1 You 1 feel 1 I 1 have 1 been 1 narrow-minded 1 and 1 suspicious?\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 at 1 all,\u201d 1 he 1 answered; 1 \u201cI 1 never 1 suggested 1 that.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 ought 1 I 1 not 1 to 1 apologize, 1 at 1 all 1 events, 1 for 1 my 1 apparent 1 rudeness?\u201d 1 He 1 replied, 1 with 1 some 1 irritation, 1 that 1 it 1 would 1 be 1 quite 1 unnecessary, 1 and 1 got 1 up 1 from 1 his 1 seat 1 to 1 go 1 to 1 the 1 smoking-room. 1 \u201cWas 1 I 1 a 1 bore?\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 he 1 had 1 disappeared. 1 \u201cWhy 1 didn\u2019t 1 you 1 talk, 1 Lucy? 1 He 1 prefers 1 young 1 people, 1 I\u2019m 1 sure. 1 I 1 do 1 hope 1 I 1 haven\u2019t 1 monopolized 1 him. 1 I 1 hoped 1 you 1 would 1 have 1 him 1 all 1 the 1 evening, 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 all 1 dinner-time.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 nice,\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cJust 1 what 1 I 1 remember. 1 He 1 seems 1 to 1 see 1 good 1 in 1 everyone. 1 No 1 one 1 would 1 take 1 him 1 for 1 a 1 clergyman.\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 dear 1 Lucia--\u201d 1 \u201cWell, 1 you 1 know 1 what 1 I 1 mean. 1 And 1 you 1 know 1 how 1 clergymen 1 generally 1 laugh; 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 laughs 1 just 1 like 1 an 1 ordinary 1 man.\u201d 1 \u201cFunny 1 girl! 1 How 1 you 1 do 1 remind 1 me 1 of 1 your 1 mother. 1 I 1 wonder 1 if 1 she 1 will 1 approve 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Beebe.\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 sure 1 she 1 will; 1 and 1 so 1 will 1 Freddy.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 everyone 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 will 1 approve; 1 it 1 is 1 the 1 fashionable 1 world. 1 I 1 am 1 used 1 to 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells, 1 where 1 we 1 are 1 all 1 hopelessly 1 behind 1 the 1 times.\u201d 1 \u201cYes,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 despondently. 1 There 1 was 1 a 1 haze 1 of 1 disapproval 1 in 1 the 1 air, 1 but 1 whether 1 the 1 disapproval 1 was 1 of 1 herself, 1 or 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 or 1 of 1 the 1 fashionable 1 world 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner, 1 or 1 of 1 the 1 narrow 1 world 1 at 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells, 1 she 1 could 1 not 1 determine. 1 She 1 tried 1 to 1 locate 1 it, 1 but 1 as 1 usual 1 she 1 blundered. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 sedulously 1 denied 1 disapproving 1 of 1 any 1 one, 1 and 1 added 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 afraid 1 you 1 are 1 finding 1 me 1 a 1 very 1 depressing 1 companion.\u201d 1 And 1 the 1 girl 1 again 1 thought: 1 \u201cI 1 must 1 have 1 been 1 selfish 1 or 1 unkind; 1 I 1 must 1 be 1 more 1 careful. 1 It 1 is 1 so 1 dreadful 1 for 1 Charlotte, 1 being 1 poor.\u201d 1 Fortunately 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 little 1 old 1 ladies, 1 who 1 for 1 some 1 time 1 had 1 been 1 smiling 1 very 1 benignly, 1 now 1 approached 1 and 1 asked 1 if 1 she 1 might 1 be 1 allowed 1 to 1 sit 1 where 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 had 1 sat. 1 Permission 1 granted, 1 she 1 began 1 to 1 chatter 1 gently 1 about 1 Italy, 1 the 1 plunge 1 it 1 had 1 been 1 to 1 come 1 there, 1 the 1 gratifying 1 success 1 of 1 the 1 plunge, 1 the 1 improvement 1 in 1 her 1 sister\u2019s 1 health, 1 the 1 necessity 1 of 1 closing 1 the 1 bed-room 1 windows 1 at 1 night, 1 and 1 of 1 thoroughly 1 emptying 1 the 1 water-bottles 1 in 1 the 1 morning. 1 She 1 handled 1 her 1 subjects 1 agreeably, 1 and 1 they 1 were, 1 perhaps, 1 more 1 worthy 1 of 1 attention 1 than 1 the 1 high 1 discourse 1 upon 1 Guelfs 1 and 1 Ghibellines 1 which 1 was 1 proceeding 1 tempestuously 1 at 1 the 1 other 1 end 1 of 1 the 1 room. 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 real 1 catastrophe, 1 not 1 a 1 mere 1 episode, 1 that 1 evening 1 of 1 hers 1 at 1 Venice, 1 when 1 she 1 had 1 found 1 in 1 her 1 bedroom 1 something 1 that 1 is 1 one 1 worse 1 than 1 a 1 flea, 1 though 1 one 1 better 1 than 1 something 1 else. 1 \u201cBut 1 here 1 you 1 are 1 as 1 safe 1 as 1 in 1 England. 1 Signora 1 Bertolini 1 is 1 so 1 English.\u201d 1 \u201cYet 1 our 1 rooms 1 smell,\u201d 1 said 1 poor 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cWe 1 dread 1 going 1 to 1 bed.\u201d 1 \u201cAh, 1 then 1 you 1 look 1 into 1 the 1 court.\u201d 1 She 1 sighed. 1 \u201cIf 1 only 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 more 1 tactful! 1 We 1 were 1 so 1 sorry 1 for 1 you 1 at 1 dinner.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 he 1 was 1 meaning 1 to 1 be 1 kind.\u201d 1 \u201cUndoubtedly 1 he 1 was,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe 1 has 1 just 1 been 1 scolding 1 me 1 for 1 my 1 suspicious 1 nature. 1 Of 1 course, 1 I 1 was 1 holding 1 back 1 on 1 my 1 cousin\u2019s 1 account.\u201d 1 \u201cOf 1 course,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 little 1 old 1 lady; 1 and 1 they 1 murmured 1 that 1 one 1 could 1 not 1 be 1 too 1 careful 1 with 1 a 1 young 1 girl. 1 Lucy 1 tried 1 to 1 look 1 demure, 1 but 1 could 1 not 1 help 1 feeling 1 a 1 great 1 fool. 1 No 1 one 1 was 1 careful 1 with 1 her 1 at 1 home; 1 or, 1 at 1 all 1 events, 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 noticed 1 it. 1 \u201cAbout 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson--I 1 hardly 1 know. 1 No, 1 he 1 is 1 not 1 tactful; 1 yet, 1 have 1 you 1 ever 1 noticed 1 that 1 there 1 are 1 people 1 who 1 do 1 things 1 which 1 are 1 most 1 indelicate, 1 and 1 yet 1 at 1 the 1 same 1 time--beautiful?\u201d 1 \u201cBeautiful?\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 puzzled 1 at 1 the 1 word. 1 \u201cAre 1 not 1 beauty 1 and 1 delicacy 1 the 1 same?\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 one 1 would 1 have 1 thought,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 other 1 helplessly. 1 \u201cBut 1 things 1 are 1 so 1 difficult, 1 I 1 sometimes 1 think.\u201d 1 She 1 proceeded 1 no 1 further 1 into 1 things, 1 for 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 reappeared, 1 looking 1 extremely 1 pleasant. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Bartlett,\u201d 1 he 1 cried, 1 \u201cit\u2019s 1 all 1 right 1 about 1 the 1 rooms. 1 I\u2019m 1 so 1 glad. 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 talking 1 about 1 it 1 in 1 the 1 smoking-room, 1 and 1 knowing 1 what 1 I 1 did, 1 I 1 encouraged 1 him 1 to 1 make 1 the 1 offer 1 again. 1 He 1 has 1 let 1 me 1 come 1 and 1 ask 1 you. 1 He 1 would 1 be 1 so 1 pleased.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Charlotte,\u201d 1 cried 1 Lucy 1 to 1 her 1 cousin, 1 \u201cwe 1 must 1 have 1 the 1 rooms 1 now. 1 The 1 old 1 man 1 is 1 just 1 as 1 nice 1 and 1 kind 1 as 1 he 1 can 1 be.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 silent. 1 \u201cI 1 fear,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 after 1 a 1 pause, 1 \u201cthat 1 I 1 have 1 been 1 officious. 1 I 1 must 1 apologize 1 for 1 my 1 interference.\u201d 1 Gravely 1 displeased, 1 he 1 turned 1 to 1 go. 1 Not 1 till 1 then 1 did 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 reply: 1 \u201cMy 1 own 1 wishes, 1 dearest 1 Lucy, 1 are 1 unimportant 1 in 1 comparison 1 with 1 yours. 1 It 1 would 1 be 1 hard 1 indeed 1 if 1 I 1 stopped 1 you 1 doing 1 as 1 you 1 liked 1 at 1 Florence, 1 when 1 I 1 am 1 only 1 here 1 through 1 your 1 kindness. 1 If 1 you 1 wish 1 me 1 to 1 turn 1 these 1 gentlemen 1 out 1 of 1 their 1 rooms, 1 I 1 will 1 do 1 it. 1 Would 1 you 1 then, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 kindly 1 tell 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 that 1 I 1 accept 1 his 1 kind 1 offer, 1 and 1 then 1 conduct 1 him 1 to 1 me, 1 in 1 order 1 that 1 I 1 may 1 thank 1 him 1 personally?\u201d 1 She 1 raised 1 her 1 voice 1 as 1 she 1 spoke; 1 it 1 was 1 heard 1 all 1 over 1 the 1 drawing-room, 1 and 1 silenced 1 the 1 Guelfs 1 and 1 the 1 Ghibellines. 1 The 1 clergyman, 1 inwardly 1 cursing 1 the 1 female 1 sex, 1 bowed, 1 and 1 departed 1 with 1 her 1 message. 1 \u201cRemember, 1 Lucy, 1 I 1 alone 1 am 1 implicated 1 in 1 this. 1 I 1 do 1 not 1 wish 1 the 1 acceptance 1 to 1 come 1 from 1 you. 1 Grant 1 me 1 that, 1 at 1 all 1 events.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 back, 1 saying 1 rather 1 nervously: 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson 1 is 1 engaged, 1 but 1 here 1 is 1 his 1 son 1 instead.\u201d 1 The 1 young 1 man 1 gazed 1 down 1 on 1 the 1 three 1 ladies, 1 who 1 felt 1 seated 1 on 1 the 1 floor, 1 so 1 low 1 were 1 their 1 chairs. 1 \u201cMy 1 father,\u201d 1 he 1 said, 1 \u201cis 1 in 1 his 1 bath, 1 so 1 you 1 cannot 1 thank 1 him 1 personally. 1 But 1 any 1 message 1 given 1 by 1 you 1 to 1 me 1 will 1 be 1 given 1 by 1 me 1 to 1 him 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 he 1 comes 1 out.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 unequal 1 to 1 the 1 bath. 1 All 1 her 1 barbed 1 civilities 1 came 1 forth 1 wrong 1 end 1 first. 1 Young 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 scored 1 a 1 notable 1 triumph 1 to 1 the 1 delight 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 and 1 to 1 the 1 secret 1 delight 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 recover 1 herself. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 saw 1 it, 1 and 1 continued 1 to 1 divert 1 the 1 conversation. 1 \u201cThese 1 particular 1 Emersons 1 consisted 1 of 1 a 1 father 1 and 1 a 1 son--the 1 son 1 a 1 goodly, 1 if 1 not 1 a 1 good 1 young 1 man; 1 not 1 a 1 fool, 1 I 1 fancy, 1 but 1 very 1 immature--pessimism, 1 et 1 cetera. 1 Our 1 special 1 joy 1 was 1 the 1 father--such 1 a 1 sentimental 1 darling, 1 and 1 people 1 declared 1 he 1 had 1 murdered 1 his 1 wife.\u201d 1 In 1 his 1 normal 1 state 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 would 1 never 1 have 1 repeated 1 such 1 gossip, 1 but 1 he 1 was 1 trying 1 to 1 shelter 1 Lucy 1 in 1 her 1 little 1 trouble. 1 He 1 repeated 1 any 1 rubbish 1 that 1 came 1 into 1 his 1 head. 1 \u201cMurdered 1 his 1 wife?\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch. 1 \u201cLucy, 1 don\u2019t 1 desert 1 us--go 1 on 1 playing 1 bumble-puppy. 1 Really, 1 the 1 Pension 1 Bertolini 1 must 1 have 1 been 1 the 1 oddest 1 place. 1 That\u2019s 1 the 1 second 1 murderer 1 I\u2019ve 1 heard 1 of 1 as 1 being 1 there. 1 Whatever 1 was 1 Charlotte 1 doing 1 to 1 stop? 1 By-the-by, 1 we 1 really 1 must 1 ask 1 Charlotte 1 here 1 some 1 time.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 could 1 recall 1 no 1 second 1 murderer. 1 He 1 suggested 1 that 1 his 1 hostess 1 was 1 mistaken. 1 At 1 the 1 hint 1 of 1 opposition 1 she 1 warmed. 1 She 1 was 1 perfectly 1 sure 1 that 1 there 1 had 1 been 1 a 1 second 1 tourist 1 of 1 whom 1 the 1 same 1 story 1 had 1 been 1 told. 1 The 1 name 1 escaped 1 her. 1 What 1 was 1 the 1 name? 1 Oh, 1 what 1 was 1 the 1 name? 1 She 1 clasped 1 her 1 knees 1 for 1 the 1 name. 1 Something 1 in 1 Thackeray. 1 She 1 struck 1 her 1 matronly 1 forehead. 1 Lucy 1 asked 1 her 1 brother 1 whether 1 Cecil 1 was 1 in. 1 \u201cOh, 1 don\u2019t 1 go!\u201d 1 he 1 cried, 1 and 1 tried 1 to 1 catch 1 her 1 by 1 the 1 ankles. 1 \u201cI 1 must 1 go,\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 gravely. 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 be 1 silly. 1 You 1 always 1 overdo 1 it 1 when 1 you 1 play.\u201d 1 As 1 she 1 left 1 them 1 her 1 mother\u2019s 1 shout 1 of 1 \u201cHarris!\u201d 1 shivered 1 the 1 tranquil 1 air, 1 and 1 reminded 1 her 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 told 1 a 1 lie 1 and 1 had 1 never 1 put 1 it 1 right. 1 Such 1 a 1 senseless 1 lie, 1 too, 1 yet 1 it 1 shattered 1 her 1 nerves 1 and 1 made 1 her 1 connect 1 these 1 Emersons, 1 friends 1 of 1 Cecil\u2019s, 1 with 1 a 1 pair 1 of 1 nondescript 1 tourists. 1 Hitherto 1 truth 1 had 1 come 1 to 1 her 1 naturally. 1 She 1 saw 1 that 1 for 1 the 1 future 1 she 1 must 1 be 1 more 1 vigilant, 1 and 1 be--absolutely 1 truthful? 1 Well, 1 at 1 all 1 events, 1 she 1 must 1 not 1 tell 1 lies. 1 She 1 hurried 1 up 1 the 1 garden, 1 still 1 flushed 1 with 1 shame. 1 A 1 word 1 from 1 Cecil 1 would 1 soothe 1 her, 1 she 1 was 1 sure. 1 \u201cCecil!\u201d 1 \u201cHullo!\u201d 1 he 1 called, 1 and 1 leant 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 smoking-room 1 window. 1 He 1 seemed 1 in 1 high 1 spirits. 1 \u201cI 1 was 1 hoping 1 you\u2019d 1 come. 1 I 1 heard 1 you 1 all 1 bear-gardening, 1 but 1 there\u2019s 1 better 1 fun 1 up 1 here. 1 I, 1 even 1 I, 1 have 1 won 1 a 1 great 1 victory 1 for 1 the 1 Comic 1 Muse. 1 George 1 Meredith\u2019s 1 right--the 1 cause 1 of 1 Comedy 1 and 1 the 1 cause 1 of 1 Truth 1 are 1 really 1 the 1 same; 1 and 1 I, 1 even 1 I, 1 have 1 found 1 tenants 1 for 1 the 1 distressful 1 Cissie 1 Villa. 1 Don\u2019t 1 be 1 angry! 1 Don\u2019t 1 be 1 angry! 1 You\u2019ll 1 forgive 1 me 1 when 1 you 1 hear 1 it 1 all.\u201d 1 He 1 looked 1 very 1 attractive 1 when 1 his 1 face 1 was 1 bright, 1 and 1 he 1 dispelled 1 her 1 ridiculous 1 forebodings 1 at 1 once. 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 heard,\u201d 1 she 1 said. 1 \u201cFreddy 1 has 1 told 1 us. 1 Naughty 1 Cecil! 1 I 1 suppose 1 I 1 must 1 forgive 1 you. 1 Just 1 think 1 of 1 all 1 the 1 trouble 1 I 1 took 1 for 1 nothing! 1 Certainly 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 are 1 a 1 little 1 tiresome, 1 and 1 I\u2019d 1 rather 1 have 1 nice 1 friends 1 of 1 yours. 1 But 1 you 1 oughtn\u2019t 1 to 1 tease 1 one 1 so.\u201d 1 \u201cFriends 1 of 1 mine?\u201d 1 he 1 laughed. 1 \u201cBut, 1 Lucy, 1 the 1 whole 1 joke 1 is 1 to 1 come! 1 Come 1 here.\u201d 1 But 1 she 1 remained 1 standing 1 where 1 she 1 was. 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 know 1 where 1 I 1 met 1 these 1 desirable 1 tenants? 1 In 1 the 1 National 1 Gallery, 1 when 1 I 1 was 1 up 1 to 1 see 1 my 1 mother 1 last 1 week.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 an 1 odd 1 place 1 to 1 meet 1 people!\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 nervously. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 quite 1 understand.\u201d 1 \u201cIn 1 the 1 Umbrian 1 Room. 1 Absolute 1 strangers. 1 They 1 were 1 admiring 1 Luca 1 Signorelli--of 1 course, 1 quite 1 stupidly. 1 However, 1 we 1 got 1 talking, 1 and 1 they 1 refreshed 1 me 1 not 1 a 1 little. 1 They 1 had 1 been 1 to 1 Italy.\u201d 1 \u201cBut, 1 Cecil--\u201d 1 proceeded 1 hilariously. 1 \u201cIn 1 the 1 course 1 of 1 conversation 1 they 1 said 1 that 1 they 1 wanted 1 a 1 country 1 cottage--the 1 father 1 to 1 live 1 there, 1 the 1 son 1 to 1 run 1 down 1 for 1 week-ends. 1 I 1 thought, 1 \u2018What 1 a 1 chance 1 of 1 scoring 1 off 1 Sir 1 Harry!\u2019 1 and 1 I 1 took 1 their 1 address 1 and 1 a 1 London 1 reference, 1 found 1 they 1 weren\u2019t 1 actual 1 blackguards--it 1 was 1 great 1 sport--and 1 wrote 1 to 1 him, 1 making 1 out--\u201d 1 \u201cCecil! 1 No, 1 it\u2019s 1 not 1 fair. 1 I\u2019ve 1 probably 1 met 1 them 1 before--\u201d 1 He 1 bore 1 her 1 down. 1 \u201cPerfectly 1 fair. 1 Anything 1 is 1 fair 1 that 1 punishes 1 a 1 snob. 1 That 1 old 1 man 1 will 1 do 1 the 1 neighbourhood 1 a 1 world 1 of 1 good. 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 is 1 too 1 disgusting 1 with 1 his 1 \u2018decayed 1 gentlewomen.\u2019 1 I 1 meant 1 to 1 read 1 him 1 a 1 lesson 1 some 1 time. 1 No, 1 Lucy, 1 the 1 classes 1 ought 1 to 1 mix, 1 and 1 before 1 long 1 you\u2019ll 1 agree 1 with 1 me. 1 There 1 ought 1 to 1 be 1 intermarriage--all 1 sorts 1 of 1 things. 1 I 1 believe 1 in 1 democracy--\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 you 1 don\u2019t,\u201d 1 she 1 snapped. 1 \u201cYou 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 what 1 the 1 word 1 means.\u201d 1 He 1 stared 1 at 1 her, 1 and 1 felt 1 again 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 failed 1 to 1 be 1 Leonardesque. 1 \u201cNo, 1 you 1 don\u2019t!\u201d 1 Her 1 face 1 was 1 inartistic--that 1 of 1 a 1 peevish 1 virago. 1 \u201cIt 1 isn\u2019t 1 fair, 1 Cecil. 1 I 1 blame 1 you--I 1 blame 1 you 1 very 1 much 1 indeed. 1 You 1 had 1 no 1 business 1 to 1 undo 1 my 1 work 1 about 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans, 1 and 1 make 1 me 1 look 1 ridiculous. 1 You 1 call 1 it 1 scoring 1 off 1 Sir 1 Harry, 1 but 1 do 1 you 1 realize 1 that 1 it 1 is 1 all 1 at 1 my 1 expense? 1 I 1 consider 1 it 1 most 1 disloyal 1 of 1 you.\u201d 1 She 1 left 1 him. 1 \u201cTemper!\u201d 1 he 1 thought, 1 raising 1 his 1 eyebrows. 1 No, 1 it 1 was 1 worse 1 than 1 temper--snobbishness. 1 As 1 long 1 as 1 Lucy 1 thought 1 that 1 his 1 own 1 smart 1 friends 1 were 1 supplanting 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans, 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 minded. 1 He 1 perceived 1 that 1 these 1 new 1 tenants 1 might 1 be 1 of 1 value 1 educationally. 1 He 1 would 1 tolerate 1 the 1 father 1 and 1 draw 1 out 1 the 1 son, 1 who 1 was 1 silent. 1 In 1 the 1 interests 1 of 1 the 1 Comic 1 Muse 1 and 1 of 1 Truth, 1 he 1 would 1 bring 1 them 1 to 1 Windy 1 Corner. 1 Chapter 1 XI: 1 In 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse\u2019s 1 Well-Appointed 1 Flat 1 The 1 Comic 1 Muse, 1 though 1 able 1 to 1 look 1 after 1 her 1 own 1 interests, 1 did 1 not 1 disdain 1 the 1 assistance 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Vyse. 1 His 1 idea 1 of 1 bringing 1 the 1 Emersons 1 to 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 struck 1 her 1 as 1 decidedly 1 good, 1 and 1 she 1 carried 1 through 1 the 1 negotiations 1 without 1 a 1 hitch. 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway 1 signed 1 the 1 agreement, 1 met 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 who 1 was 1 duly 1 disillusioned. 1 The 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 were 1 duly 1 offended, 1 and 1 wrote 1 a 1 dignified 1 letter 1 to 1 Lucy, 1 whom 1 they 1 held 1 responsible 1 for 1 the 1 failure. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 planned 1 pleasant 1 moments 1 for 1 the 1 new-comers, 1 and 1 told 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 that 1 Freddy 1 must 1 call 1 on 1 them 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 they 1 arrived. 1 Indeed, 1 so 1 ample 1 was 1 the 1 Muse\u2019s 1 equipment 1 that 1 she 1 permitted 1 Mr. 1 Harris, 1 never 1 a 1 very 1 robust 1 criminal, 1 to 1 droop 1 his 1 head, 1 to 1 be 1 forgotten, 1 and 1 to 1 die. 1 Lucy--to 1 descend 1 from 1 bright 1 heaven 1 to 1 earth, 1 whereon 1 there 1 are 1 shadows 1 because 1 there 1 are 1 hills--Lucy 1 was 1 at 1 first 1 plunged 1 into 1 despair, 1 but 1 settled 1 after 1 a 1 little 1 thought 1 that 1 it 1 did 1 not 1 matter 1 the 1 very 1 least. 1 Now 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 engaged, 1 the 1 Emersons 1 would 1 scarcely 1 insult 1 her 1 and 1 were 1 welcome 1 into 1 the 1 neighbourhood. 1 And 1 Cecil 1 was 1 welcome 1 to 1 bring 1 whom 1 he 1 would 1 into 1 the 1 neighbourhood. 1 Therefore 1 Cecil 1 was 1 welcome 1 to 1 bring 1 the 1 Emersons 1 into 1 the 1 neighbourhood. 1 But, 1 as 1 I 1 say, 1 this 1 took 1 a 1 little 1 thinking, 1 and--so 1 illogical 1 are 1 girls--the 1 event 1 remained 1 rather 1 greater 1 and 1 rather 1 more 1 dreadful 1 than 1 it 1 should 1 have 1 done. 1 She 1 was 1 glad 1 that 1 a 1 visit 1 to 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 now 1 fell 1 due; 1 the 1 tenants 1 moved 1 into 1 Cissie 1 Villa 1 while 1 she 1 was 1 safe 1 in 1 the 1 London 1 flat. 1 \u201cCecil--Cecil 1 darling,\u201d 1 she 1 whispered 1 the 1 evening 1 she 1 arrived, 1 and 1 crept 1 into 1 his 1 arms. 1 Cecil, 1 too, 1 became 1 demonstrative. 1 He 1 saw 1 that 1 the 1 needful 1 fire 1 had 1 been 1 kindled 1 in 1 Lucy. 1 At 1 last 1 she 1 longed 1 for 1 attention, 1 as 1 a 1 woman 1 should, 1 and 1 looked 1 up 1 to 1 him 1 because 1 he 1 was 1 a 1 man. 1 \u201cSo 1 you 1 do 1 love 1 me, 1 little 1 thing?\u201d 1 he 1 murmured. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Cecil, 1 I 1 do, 1 I 1 do! 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 what 1 I 1 should 1 do 1 without 1 you.\u201d 1 Several 1 days 1 passed. 1 Then 1 she 1 had 1 a 1 letter 1 from 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 A 1 coolness 1 had 1 sprung 1 up 1 between 1 the 1 two 1 cousins, 1 and 1 they 1 had 1 not 1 corresponded 1 since 1 they 1 parted 1 in 1 August. 1 The 1 coolness 1 dated 1 from 1 what 1 Charlotte 1 would 1 call 1 \u201cthe 1 flight 1 to 1 Rome,\u201d 1 and 1 in 1 Rome 1 it 1 had 1 increased 1 amazingly. 1 For 1 the 1 companion 1 who 1 is 1 merely 1 uncongenial 1 in 1 the 1 mediaeval 1 world 1 becomes 1 exasperating 1 in 1 the 1 classical. 1 Charlotte, 1 unselfish 1 in 1 the 1 Forum, 1 would 1 have 1 tried 1 a 1 sweeter 1 temper 1 than 1 Lucy\u2019s, 1 and 1 once, 1 in 1 the 1 Baths 1 of 1 Caracalla, 1 they 1 had 1 doubted 1 whether 1 they 1 could 1 continue 1 their 1 tour. 1 Lucy 1 had 1 said 1 she 1 would 1 join 1 the 1 Vyses--Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 was 1 an 1 acquaintance 1 of 1 her 1 mother, 1 so 1 there 1 was 1 no 1 impropriety 1 in 1 the 1 plan 1 and 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 replied 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 quite 1 used 1 to 1 being 1 abandoned 1 suddenly. 1 Finally 1 nothing 1 happened; 1 but 1 the 1 coolness 1 remained, 1 and, 1 for 1 Lucy, 1 was 1 even 1 increased 1 when 1 she 1 opened 1 the 1 letter 1 and 1 read 1 as 1 follows. 1 It 1 had 1 been 1 forwarded 1 from 1 Windy 1 Corner. 1 \u201cTunbridge 1 Wells, 1 \u201cSeptember. 1 \u201cDearest 1 Lucia, 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 news 1 of 1 you 1 at 1 last! 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 has 1 been 1 bicycling 1 in 1 your 1 parts, 1 but 1 was 1 not 1 sure 1 whether 1 a 1 call 1 would 1 be 1 welcome. 1 Puncturing 1 her 1 tire 1 near 1 Summer 1 Street, 1 and 1 it 1 being 1 mended 1 while 1 she 1 sat 1 very 1 woebegone 1 in 1 that 1 pretty 1 churchyard, 1 she 1 saw 1 to 1 her 1 astonishment, 1 a 1 door 1 open 1 opposite 1 and 1 the 1 younger 1 Emerson 1 man 1 come 1 out. 1 He 1 said 1 his 1 father 1 had 1 just 1 taken 1 the 1 house. 1 He 1 SAID 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 know 1 that 1 you 1 lived 1 in 1 the 1 neighbourhood 1 (?). 1 He 1 never 1 suggested 1 giving 1 Eleanor 1 a 1 cup 1 of 1 tea. 1 Dear 1 Lucy, 1 I 1 am 1 much 1 worried, 1 and 1 I 1 advise 1 you 1 to 1 make 1 a 1 clean 1 breast 1 of 1 his 1 past 1 behaviour 1 to 1 your 1 mother, 1 Freddy, 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Vyse, 1 who 1 will 1 forbid 1 him 1 to 1 enter 1 the 1 house, 1 etc. 1 That 1 was 1 a 1 great 1 misfortune, 1 and 1 I 1 dare 1 say 1 you 1 have 1 told 1 them 1 already. 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 is 1 so 1 sensitive. 1 I 1 remember 1 how 1 I 1 used 1 to 1 get 1 on 1 his 1 nerves 1 at 1 Rome. 1 I 1 am 1 very 1 sorry 1 about 1 it 1 all, 1 and 1 should 1 not 1 feel 1 easy 1 unless 1 I 1 warned 1 you. 1 \u201cBelieve 1 me, 1 \u201cYour 1 anxious 1 and 1 loving 1 cousin, 1 \u201cCharlotte.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 was 1 much 1 annoyed, 1 and 1 replied 1 as 1 follows: 1 \u201cBeauchamp 1 Mansions, 1 S.W. 1 \u201cDear 1 Charlotte, 1 \u201cMany 1 thanks 1 for 1 your 1 warning. 1 When 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 forgot 1 himself 1 on 1 the 1 mountain, 1 you 1 made 1 me 1 promise 1 not 1 to 1 tell 1 mother, 1 because 1 you 1 said 1 she 1 would 1 blame 1 you 1 for 1 not 1 being 1 always 1 with 1 me. 1 I 1 have 1 kept 1 that 1 promise, 1 and 1 cannot 1 possibly 1 tell 1 her 1 now. 1 I 1 have 1 said 1 both 1 to 1 her 1 and 1 Cecil 1 that 1 I 1 met 1 the 1 Emersons 1 at 1 Florence, 1 and 1 that 1 they 1 are 1 respectable 1 people--which 1 I 1 do 1 think--and 1 the 1 reason 1 that 1 he 1 offered 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 no 1 tea 1 was 1 probably 1 that 1 he 1 had 1 none 1 himself. 1 She 1 should 1 have 1 tried 1 at 1 the 1 Rectory. 1 I 1 cannot 1 begin 1 making 1 a 1 fuss 1 at 1 this 1 stage. 1 You 1 must 1 see 1 that 1 it 1 would 1 be 1 too 1 absurd. 1 If 1 the 1 Emersons 1 heard 1 I 1 had 1 complained 1 of 1 them, 1 they 1 would 1 think 1 themselves 1 of 1 importance, 1 which 1 is 1 exactly 1 what 1 they 1 are 1 not. 1 I 1 you 1 remember 1 that 1 her 1 boiler 1 was 1 to 1 be 1 had 1 out 1 in 1 October, 1 and 1 her 1 bath 1 cistern 1 cleaned 1 out, 1 and 1 all 1 kinds 1 of 1 terrible 1 to-doings?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 remember 1 all 1 Charlotte\u2019s 1 worries,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 bitterly. 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 have 1 enough 1 of 1 my 1 own, 1 now 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 not 1 pleased 1 with 1 Cecil.\u201d 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 might 1 have 1 flamed 1 out. 1 She 1 did 1 not. 1 She 1 said: 1 \u201cCome 1 here, 1 old 1 lady--thank 1 you 1 for 1 putting 1 away 1 my 1 bonnet--kiss 1 me.\u201d 1 And, 1 though 1 nothing 1 is 1 perfect, 1 Lucy 1 felt 1 for 1 the 1 moment 1 that 1 her 1 mother 1 and 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 and 1 the 1 Weald 1 in 1 the 1 declining 1 sun 1 were 1 perfect. 1 So 1 the 1 grittiness 1 went 1 out 1 of 1 life. 1 It 1 generally 1 did 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner. 1 At 1 the 1 last 1 minute, 1 when 1 the 1 social 1 machine 1 was 1 clogged 1 hopelessly, 1 one 1 member 1 or 1 other 1 of 1 the 1 family 1 poured 1 in 1 a 1 drop 1 of 1 oil. 1 Cecil 1 despised 1 their 1 methods--perhaps 1 rightly. 1 At 1 all 1 events, 1 they 1 were 1 not 1 his 1 own. 1 Dinner 1 was 1 at 1 half-past 1 seven. 1 Freddy 1 gabbled 1 the 1 grace, 1 and 1 they 1 drew 1 up 1 their 1 heavy 1 chairs 1 and 1 fell 1 to. 1 Fortunately, 1 the 1 men 1 were 1 hungry. 1 Nothing 1 untoward 1 occurred 1 until 1 the 1 pudding. 1 Then 1 Freddy 1 said: 1 \u201cLucy, 1 what\u2019s 1 Emerson 1 like?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 saw 1 him 1 in 1 Florence,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 hoping 1 that 1 this 1 would 1 pass 1 for 1 a 1 reply. 1 \u201cIs 1 he 1 the 1 clever 1 sort, 1 or 1 is 1 he 1 a 1 decent 1 chap?\u201d 1 \u201cAsk 1 Cecil; 1 it 1 is 1 Cecil 1 who 1 brought 1 him 1 here.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 the 1 clever 1 sort, 1 like 1 myself,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 Freddy 1 looked 1 at 1 him 1 doubtfully. 1 \u201cHow 1 well 1 did 1 you 1 know 1 them 1 at 1 the 1 Bertolini?\u201d 1 asked 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch. 1 \u201cOh, 1 very 1 slightly. 1 I 1 mean, 1 Charlotte 1 knew 1 them 1 even 1 less 1 than 1 I 1 did.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 that 1 reminds 1 me--you 1 never 1 told 1 me 1 what 1 Charlotte 1 said 1 in 1 her 1 letter.\u201d 1 \u201cOne 1 thing 1 and 1 another,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 wondering 1 whether 1 she 1 would 1 get 1 through 1 the 1 meal 1 without 1 a 1 lie. 1 \u201cAmong 1 other 1 things, 1 that 1 an 1 awful 1 friend 1 of 1 hers 1 had 1 been 1 bicycling 1 through 1 Summer 1 Street, 1 wondered 1 if 1 she\u2019d 1 come 1 up 1 and 1 see 1 us, 1 and 1 mercifully 1 didn\u2019t.\u201d 1 \u201cLucy, 1 I 1 do 1 call 1 the 1 way 1 you 1 talk 1 unkind.\u201d 1 \u201cShe 1 was 1 a 1 novelist,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 craftily. 1 The 1 remark 1 was 1 a 1 happy 1 one, 1 for 1 nothing 1 roused 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 so 1 much 1 as 1 literature 1 in 1 the 1 hands 1 of 1 females. 1 She 1 would 1 abandon 1 every 1 topic 1 to 1 inveigh 1 against 1 those 1 women 1 who 1 (instead 1 of 1 minding 1 their 1 houses 1 and 1 their 1 children) 1 seek 1 notoriety 1 by 1 print. 1 Her 1 attitude 1 was: 1 \u201cIf 1 books 1 must 1 be 1 written, 1 let 1 them 1 be 1 written 1 by 1 men\u201d; 1 and 1 she 1 developed 1 it 1 at 1 great 1 length, 1 while 1 Cecil 1 yawned 1 and 1 Freddy 1 played 1 at 1 \u201cThis 1 year, 1 next 1 year, 1 now, 1 never,\u201d 1 with 1 his 1 plum-stones, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 artfully 1 fed 1 the 1 flames 1 of 1 her 1 mother\u2019s 1 wrath. 1 But 1 soon 1 the 1 conflagration 1 died 1 down, 1 and 1 the 1 ghosts 1 began 1 to 1 gather 1 in 1 the 1 darkness. 1 There 1 were 1 too 1 many 1 ghosts 1 about. 1 The 1 original 1 ghost--that 1 touch 1 of 1 lips 1 on 1 her 1 cheek--had 1 surely 1 been 1 laid 1 long 1 ago; 1 it 1 could 1 be 1 nothing 1 to 1 her 1 that 1 a 1 man 1 had 1 kissed 1 her 1 on 1 a 1 mountain 1 once. 1 But 1 it 1 had 1 begotten 1 a 1 spectral 1 family--Mr. 1 Harris, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 letter, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 memories 1 of 1 violets--and 1 one 1 or 1 other 1 of 1 these 1 was 1 bound 1 to 1 haunt 1 her 1 before 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 very 1 eyes. 1 It 1 was 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 who 1 returned 1 now, 1 and 1 with 1 appalling 1 vividness. 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 been 1 thinking, 1 Lucy, 1 of 1 that 1 letter 1 of 1 Charlotte\u2019s. 1 How 1 is 1 she?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 tore 1 the 1 thing 1 up.\u201d 1 \u201cDidn\u2019t 1 she 1 say 1 how 1 she 1 was? 1 How 1 does 1 she 1 sound? 1 Cheerful?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 yes 1 I 1 suppose 1 so--no--not 1 very 1 cheerful, 1 I 1 suppose.\u201d 1 \u201cThen, 1 depend 1 upon 1 it, 1 it 1 IS 1 the 1 boiler. 1 I 1 know 1 myself 1 how 1 water 1 preys 1 upon 1 one\u2019s 1 mind. 1 I 1 would 1 rather 1 anything 1 else--even 1 a 1 misfortune 1 with 1 the 1 meat.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 laid 1 his 1 hand 1 over 1 his 1 eyes. 1 \u201cSo 1 would 1 I,\u201d 1 asserted 1 Freddy, 1 backing 1 his 1 mother 1 up--backing 1 up 1 the 1 spirit 1 of 1 her 1 remark 1 rather 1 than 1 the 1 substance. 1 \u201cAnd 1 I 1 have 1 been 1 thinking,\u201d 1 she 1 added 1 rather 1 nervously, 1 \u201csurely 1 we 1 could 1 squeeze 1 Charlotte 1 in 1 here 1 next 1 week, 1 and 1 give 1 her 1 a 1 nice 1 holiday 1 while 1 plumbers 1 at 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells 1 finish. 1 I 1 have 1 not 1 seen 1 poor 1 Charlotte 1 for 1 so 1 long.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 more 1 than 1 her 1 nerves 1 could 1 stand. 1 And 1 she 1 could 1 not 1 protest 1 violently 1 after 1 her 1 mother\u2019s 1 goodness 1 to 1 her 1 upstairs. 1 \u201cMother, 1 no!\u201d 1 she 1 pleaded. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 impossible. 1 We 1 can\u2019t 1 have 1 Charlotte 1 on 1 the 1 top 1 of 1 the 1 other 1 things; 1 we\u2019re 1 squeezed 1 to 1 death 1 as 1 it 1 is. 1 Freddy\u2019s 1 got 1 a 1 friend 1 coming 1 Tuesday, 1 there\u2019s 1 Cecil, 1 and 1 you\u2019ve 1 promised 1 to 1 take 1 in 1 Minnie 1 Beebe 1 because 1 of 1 the 1 diphtheria 1 scare. 1 It 1 simply 1 can\u2019t 1 be 1 done.\u201d 1 \u201cNonsense! 1 It 1 can.\u201d 1 \u201cIf 1 Minnie 1 sleeps 1 in 1 the 1 bath. 1 Not 1 otherwise.\u201d 1 \u201cMinnie 1 can 1 sleep 1 with 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 won\u2019t 1 have 1 her.\u201d 1 \u201cThen, 1 if 1 you\u2019re 1 so 1 selfish, 1 Mr. 1 Floyd 1 must 1 share 1 a 1 room 1 with 1 Freddy.\u201d 1 \u201cMiss 1 Bartlett, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett,\u201d 1 moaned 1 Cecil, 1 again 1 laying 1 his 1 hand 1 over 1 his 1 eyes. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 impossible,\u201d 1 repeated 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 want 1 to 1 make 1 difficulties, 1 but 1 it 1 really 1 isn\u2019t 1 fair 1 on 1 the 1 maids 1 to 1 fill 1 up 1 the 1 house 1 so.\u201d 1 Alas! 1 \u201cThe 1 truth 1 is, 1 dear, 1 you 1 don\u2019t 1 like 1 Charlotte.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 don\u2019t. 1 And 1 no 1 more 1 does 1 Cecil. 1 She 1 gets 1 on 1 our 1 nerves. 1 You 1 haven\u2019t 1 seen 1 her 1 lately, 1 and 1 don\u2019t 1 realize 1 how 1 tiresome 1 she 1 can 1 be, 1 though 1 so 1 good. 1 So 1 please, 1 mother, 1 don\u2019t 1 worry 1 us 1 this 1 last 1 summer; 1 but 1 spoil 1 us 1 by 1 not 1 asking 1 her 1 to 1 come.\u201d 1 \u201cHear, 1 hear!\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 with 1 more 1 gravity 1 than 1 usual, 1 and 1 with 1 more 1 feeling 1 than 1 she 1 usually 1 permitted 1 herself, 1 replied: 1 \u201cThis 1 isn\u2019t 1 very 1 kind 1 of 1 you 1 two. 1 You 1 have 1 each 1 other 1 and 1 all 1 these 1 woods 1 to 1 walk 1 in, 1 so 1 full 1 of 1 beautiful 1 things; 1 and 1 poor 1 Charlotte 1 has 1 only 1 the 1 water 1 turned 1 off 1 and 1 plumbers. 1 You 1 are 1 young, 1 dears, 1 and 1 however 1 clever 1 young 1 people 1 are, 1 and 1 however 1 many 1 books 1 they 1 read, 1 they 1 will 1 never 1 guess 1 what 1 it 1 feels 1 like 1 to 1 grow 1 old.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 crumbled 1 his 1 bread. 1 \u201cI 1 must 1 say 1 Cousin 1 Charlotte 1 was 1 very 1 kind 1 to 1 me 1 that 1 year 1 I 1 called 1 on 1 my 1 bike,\u201d 1 put 1 in 1 Freddy. 1 \u201cShe 1 thanked 1 me 1 for 1 coming 1 till 1 I 1 felt 1 like 1 such 1 a 1 fool, 1 and 1 fussed 1 round 1 no 1 end 1 to 1 get 1 an 1 egg 1 boiled 1 for 1 my 1 tea 1 just 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 know, 1 dear. 1 She 1 is 1 kind 1 to 1 everyone, 1 and 1 yet 1 Lucy 1 makes 1 this 1 difficulty 1 when 1 we 1 try 1 to 1 give 1 her 1 some 1 little 1 return.\u201d 1 But 1 Lucy 1 hardened 1 her 1 heart. 1 It 1 was 1 no 1 good 1 being 1 kind 1 to 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 She 1 had 1 tried 1 herself 1 too 1 often 1 and 1 too 1 recently. 1 One 1 might 1 lay 1 up 1 treasure 1 in 1 heaven 1 by 1 the 1 attempt, 1 but 1 one 1 enriched 1 neither 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 nor 1 any 1 one 1 else 1 upon 1 earth. 1 She 1 was 1 reduced 1 to 1 saying: 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 help 1 it, 1 mother. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 like 1 Charlotte. 1 I 1 admit 1 it\u2019s 1 horrid 1 of 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cFrom 1 your 1 own 1 account, 1 you 1 told 1 her 1 as 1 much.\u201d 1 \u201cWell, 1 she 1 would 1 leave 1 Florence 1 so 1 stupidly. 1 She 1 flurried--\u201d 1 The 1 ghosts 1 were 1 returning; 1 they 1 filled 1 Italy, 1 they 1 were 1 even 1 usurping 1 the 1 places 1 she 1 had 1 known 1 as 1 a 1 child. 1 The 1 Sacred 1 Lake 1 would 1 never 1 be 1 the 1 same 1 again, 1 and, 1 on 1 Sunday 1 week, 1 something 1 would 1 even 1 happen 1 to 1 Windy 1 Corner. 1 How 1 would 1 she 1 fight 1 against 1 ghosts? 1 For 1 a 1 moment 1 the 1 visible 1 world 1 faded 1 away, 1 and 1 memories 1 and 1 emotions 1 alone 1 seemed 1 real. 1 \u201cI 1 suppose 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 must 1 come, 1 since 1 she 1 boils 1 eggs 1 so 1 well,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 was 1 in 1 rather 1 a 1 happier 1 frame 1 of 1 mind, 1 thanks 1 to 1 the 1 admirable 1 cooking. 1 \u201cI 1 didn\u2019t 1 mean 1 the 1 egg 1 was 1 WELL 1 boiled,\u201d 1 corrected 1 Freddy, 1 \u201cbecause 1 in 1 point 1 of 1 fact 1 she 1 forgot 1 to 1 take 1 it 1 off, 1 and 1 as 1 a 1 matter 1 of 1 fact 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 care 1 for 1 eggs. 1 I 1 only 1 meant 1 how 1 jolly 1 kind 1 she 1 seemed.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 frowned 1 again. 1 Oh, 1 these 1 Honeychurches! 1 Eggs, 1 boilers, 1 hydrangeas, 1 maids--of 1 such 1 were 1 their 1 lives 1 compact. 1 \u201cMay 1 me 1 and 1 Lucy 1 get 1 down 1 from 1 our 1 chairs?\u201d 1 he 1 asked, 1 with 1 scarcely 1 veiled 1 insolence. 1 \u201cWe 1 don\u2019t 1 want 1 no 1 dessert.\u201d 1 Chapter 1 XIV: 1 How 1 Lucy 1 Faced 1 the 1 External 1 Situation 1 Bravely 1 Of 1 course 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 accepted. 1 And, 1 equally 1 of 1 course, 1 she 1 felt 1 sure 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 prove 1 a 1 nuisance, 1 and 1 begged 1 to 1 be 1 given 1 an 1 inferior 1 spare 1 room--something 1 with 1 no 1 view, 1 anything. 1 Her 1 love 1 to 1 Lucy. 1 And, 1 equally 1 of 1 course, 1 George 1 Emerson 1 could 1 come 1 to 1 tennis 1 on 1 the 1 Sunday 1 week. 1 Lucy 1 faced 1 the 1 situation 1 bravely, 1 though, 1 like 1 most 1 of 1 us, 1 she 1 only 1 faced 1 the 1 situation 1 that 1 encompassed 1 her. 1 She 1 never 1 gazed 1 inwards. 1 If 1 at 1 times 1 strange 1 images 1 rose 1 from 1 the 1 depths, 1 she 1 put 1 them 1 down 1 to 1 nerves. 1 When 1 Cecil 1 brought 1 the 1 Emersons 1 to 1 Summer 1 Street, 1 it 1 had 1 upset 1 her 1 nerves. 1 Charlotte 1 would 1 burnish 1 up 1 past 1 foolishness, 1 and 1 this 1 might 1 upset 1 her 1 nerves. 1 She 1 was 1 nervous 1 at 1 night. 1 When 1 she 1 talked 1 to 1 George--they 1 met 1 again 1 almost 1 immediately 1 at 1 the 1 Rectory--his 1 voice 1 moved 1 her 1 deeply, 1 and 1 she 1 wished 1 to 1 remain 1 near 1 him. 1 How 1 dreadful 1 if 1 she 1 really 1 wished 1 to 1 remain 1 near 1 him! 1 Of 1 course, 1 the 1 wish 1 was 1 due 1 to 1 nerves, 1 which 1 love 1 to 1 play 1 such 1 perverse 1 tricks 1 upon 1 us. 1 Once 1 she 1 had 1 suffered 1 from 1 \u201cthings 1 that 1 came 1 out 1 of 1 nothing 1 and 1 meant 1 she 1 didn\u2019t 1 know 1 what.\u201d 1 Now 1 Cecil 1 had 1 explained 1 psychology 1 to 1 her 1 one 1 wet 1 afternoon, 1 and 1 all 1 the 1 troubles 1 of 1 youth 1 in 1 an 1 unknown 1 world 1 could 1 be 1 dismissed. 1 It 1 is 1 obvious 1 enough 1 for 1 the 1 reader 1 to 1 conclude, 1 \u201cShe 1 loves 1 young 1 Emerson.\u201d 1 A 1 reader 1 in 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 place 1 would 1 not 1 find 1 it 1 obvious. 1 Life 1 is 1 easy 1 to 1 chronicle, 1 but 1 bewildering 1 to 1 practice, 1 and 1 we 1 welcome 1 \u201cnerves\u201d 1 or 1 any 1 other 1 shibboleth 1 that 1 will 1 cloak 1 our 1 personal 1 desire. 1 She 1 loved 1 Cecil; 1 George 1 made 1 her 1 nervous; 1 will 1 the 1 reader 1 explain 1 to 1 her 1 that 1 the 1 phrases 1 should 1 have 1 been 1 reversed? 1 But 1 the 1 external 1 situation--she 1 will 1 face 1 that 1 bravely. 1 The 1 meeting 1 at 1 the 1 Rectory 1 had 1 passed 1 off 1 well 1 enough. 1 Standing 1 between 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 and 1 Cecil, 1 she 1 had 1 made 1 a 1 few 1 temperate 1 allusions 1 to 1 Italy, 1 and 1 George 1 had 1 replied. 1 She 1 was 1 anxious 1 to 1 show 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 shy, 1 and 1 was 1 glad 1 that 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 seem 1 shy 1 either. 1 \u201cA 1 nice 1 fellow,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 afterwards 1 \u201cHe 1 will 1 work 1 off 1 his 1 crudities 1 in 1 time. 1 I 1 rather 1 mistrust 1 young 1 men 1 who 1 slip 1 into 1 life 1 gracefully.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 said, 1 \u201cHe 1 seems 1 in 1 better 1 spirits. 1 He 1 laughs 1 more.\u201d 1 \u201cYes,\u201d 1 replied 1 the 1 clergyman. 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 waking 1 up.\u201d 1 That 1 was 1 all. 1 But, 1 as 1 the 1 week 1 wore 1 on, 1 more 1 of 1 her 1 defences 1 fell, 1 and 1 she 1 entertained 1 an 1 image 1 that 1 had 1 physical 1 beauty. 1 In 1 spite 1 of 1 the 1 clearest 1 directions, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 contrived 1 to 1 bungle 1 her 1 arrival. 1 She 1 was 1 due 1 at 1 the 1 South-Eastern 1 station 1 at 1 Dorking, 1 whither 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 drove 1 to 1 meet 1 her. 1 She 1 arrived 1 at 1 the 1 London 1 and 1 Brighton 1 station, 1 and 1 had 1 to 1 hire 1 a 1 cab 1 up. 1 No 1 one 1 was 1 at 1 home 1 except 1 Freddy 1 and 1 his 1 friend, 1 who 1 power 1 they 1 have 1 over 1 us 1 is 1 sometimes 1 supernatural, 1 for 1 the 1 same 1 reason.\u201d 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 lips 1 parted. 1 \u201cFor 1 a 1 crowd 1 is 1 more 1 than 1 the 1 people 1 who 1 make 1 it 1 up. 1 Something 1 gets 1 added 1 to 1 it--no 1 one 1 knows 1 how--just 1 as 1 something 1 has 1 got 1 added 1 to 1 those 1 hills.\u201d 1 He 1 pointed 1 with 1 his 1 racquet 1 to 1 the 1 South 1 Downs. 1 \u201cWhat 1 a 1 splendid 1 idea!\u201d 1 she 1 murmured. 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 enjoy 1 hearing 1 your 1 father 1 talk 1 again. 1 I\u2019m 1 so 1 sorry 1 he\u2019s 1 not 1 so 1 well.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 he 1 isn\u2019t 1 well.\u201d 1 \u201cThere\u2019s 1 an 1 absurd 1 account 1 of 1 a 1 view 1 in 1 this 1 book,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cAlso 1 that 1 men 1 fall 1 into 1 two 1 classes--those 1 who 1 forget 1 views 1 and 1 those 1 who 1 remember 1 them, 1 even 1 in 1 small 1 rooms.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson, 1 have 1 you 1 any 1 brothers 1 or 1 sisters?\u201d 1 \u201cNone. 1 Why?\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 spoke 1 of 1 \u2018us.\u2019\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 mother, 1 I 1 was 1 meaning.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 closed 1 the 1 novel 1 with 1 a 1 bang. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Cecil--how 1 you 1 made 1 me 1 jump!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 will 1 inflict 1 Joseph 1 Emery 1 Prank 1 on 1 you 1 no 1 longer.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can 1 just 1 remember 1 us 1 all 1 three 1 going 1 into 1 the 1 country 1 for 1 the 1 day 1 and 1 seeing 1 as 1 far 1 as 1 Hindhead. 1 It 1 is 1 the 1 first 1 thing 1 that 1 I 1 remember.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 got 1 up; 1 the 1 man 1 was 1 ill-bred--he 1 hadn\u2019t 1 put 1 on 1 his 1 coat 1 after 1 tennis--he 1 didn\u2019t 1 do. 1 He 1 would 1 have 1 strolled 1 away 1 if 1 Lucy 1 had 1 not 1 stopped 1 him. 1 \u201cCecil, 1 do 1 read 1 the 1 thing 1 about 1 the 1 view.\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 while 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 is 1 here 1 to 1 entertain 1 us.\u201d 1 \u201cNo--read 1 away. 1 I 1 think 1 nothing\u2019s 1 funnier 1 than 1 to 1 hear 1 silly 1 things 1 read 1 out 1 loud. 1 If 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 thinks 1 us 1 frivolous, 1 he 1 can 1 go.\u201d 1 This 1 struck 1 Cecil 1 as 1 subtle, 1 and 1 pleased 1 him. 1 It 1 put 1 their 1 visitor 1 in 1 the 1 position 1 of 1 a 1 prig. 1 Somewhat 1 mollified, 1 he 1 sat 1 down 1 again. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson, 1 go 1 and 1 find 1 tennis 1 balls.\u201d 1 She 1 opened 1 the 1 book. 1 Cecil 1 must 1 have 1 his 1 reading 1 and 1 anything 1 else 1 that 1 he 1 liked. 1 But 1 her 1 attention 1 wandered 1 to 1 George\u2019s 1 mother, 1 who--according 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Eager--had 1 been 1 murdered 1 in 1 the 1 sight 1 of 1 God 1 and--according 1 to 1 her 1 son--had 1 seen 1 as 1 far 1 as 1 Hindhead. 1 \u201cAm 1 I 1 really 1 to 1 go?\u201d 1 asked 1 George. 1 \u201cNo, 1 of 1 course 1 not 1 really,\u201d 1 she 1 answered. 1 \u201cChapter 1 two,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 yawning. 1 \u201cFind 1 me 1 chapter 1 two, 1 if 1 it 1 isn\u2019t 1 bothering 1 you.\u201d 1 Chapter 1 two 1 was 1 found, 1 and 1 she 1 glanced 1 at 1 its 1 opening 1 sentences. 1 She 1 thought 1 she 1 had 1 gone 1 mad. 1 \u201cHere--hand 1 me 1 the 1 book.\u201d 1 She 1 heard 1 her 1 voice 1 saying: 1 \u201cIt 1 isn\u2019t 1 worth 1 reading--it\u2019s 1 too 1 silly 1 to 1 read--I 1 never 1 saw 1 such 1 rubbish--it 1 oughtn\u2019t 1 to 1 be 1 allowed 1 to 1 be 1 printed.\u201d 1 He 1 took 1 the 1 book 1 from 1 her. 1 \u201c\u2018Leonora,\u2019\u201d 1 he 1 read, 1 \u201c\u2018sat 1 pensive 1 and 1 alone. 1 Before 1 her 1 lay 1 the 1 rich 1 champaign 1 of 1 Tuscany, 1 dotted 1 over 1 with 1 many 1 a 1 smiling 1 village. 1 The 1 season 1 was 1 spring.\u2019\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 knew, 1 somehow, 1 and 1 had 1 printed 1 the 1 past 1 in 1 draggled 1 prose, 1 for 1 Cecil 1 to 1 read 1 and 1 for 1 George 1 to 1 hear. 1 \u201c\u2018A 1 golden 1 haze,\u2019\u201d 1 he 1 read. 1 He 1 read: 1 \u201c\u2018Afar 1 off 1 the 1 towers 1 of 1 Florence, 1 while 1 the 1 bank 1 on 1 which 1 she 1 sat 1 was 1 carpeted 1 with 1 violets. 1 All 1 unobserved 1 Antonio 1 stole 1 up 1 behind 1 her--\u2019\u201d 1 Lest 1 Cecil 1 should 1 see 1 her 1 face 1 she 1 turned 1 to 1 George 1 and 1 saw 1 his 1 face. 1 He 1 read: 1 \u201c\u2018There 1 came 1 from 1 his 1 lips 1 no 1 wordy 1 protestation 1 such 1 as 1 formal 1 lovers 1 use. 1 No 1 eloquence 1 was 1 his, 1 nor 1 did 1 he 1 suffer 1 from 1 the 1 lack 1 of 1 it. 1 He 1 simply 1 enfolded 1 her 1 in 1 his 1 manly 1 arms.\u2019\u201d 1 \u201cThis 1 isn\u2019t 1 the 1 passage 1 I 1 wanted,\u201d 1 he 1 informed 1 them, 1 \u201cthere 1 is 1 another 1 much 1 funnier, 1 further 1 on.\u201d 1 He 1 turned 1 over 1 the 1 leaves. 1 \u201cShould 1 we 1 go 1 in 1 to 1 tea?\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 whose 1 voice 1 remained 1 steady. 1 She 1 led 1 the 1 way 1 up 1 the 1 garden, 1 Cecil 1 following 1 her, 1 George 1 last. 1 She 1 thought 1 a 1 disaster 1 was 1 averted. 1 But 1 when 1 they 1 entered 1 the 1 shrubbery 1 it 1 came. 1 The 1 book, 1 as 1 if 1 it 1 had 1 not 1 worked 1 mischief 1 enough, 1 had 1 been 1 forgotten, 1 and 1 Cecil 1 must 1 go 1 back 1 for 1 it; 1 and 1 George, 1 who 1 loved 1 passionately, 1 must 1 blunder 1 against 1 her 1 in 1 the 1 narrow 1 path. 1 \u201cNo--\u201d 1 she 1 gasped, 1 and, 1 for 1 the 1 second 1 time, 1 was 1 kissed 1 by 1 him. 1 As 1 if 1 no 1 more 1 was 1 possible, 1 he 1 slipped 1 back; 1 Cecil 1 rejoined 1 her; 1 they 1 reached 1 the 1 upper 1 lawn 1 alone. 1 Chapter 1 XVI: 1 Lying 1 to 1 George 1 But 1 Lucy 1 had 1 developed 1 since 1 the 1 spring. 1 That 1 is 1 to 1 say, 1 she 1 was 1 now 1 better 1 able 1 to 1 stifle 1 the 1 emotions 1 of 1 which 1 the 1 conventions 1 and 1 the 1 world 1 disapprove. 1 Though 1 the 1 danger 1 was 1 greater, 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 shaken 1 by 1 deep 1 sobs. 1 She 1 said 1 to 1 Cecil, 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 not 1 coming 1 in 1 to 1 tea--tell 1 mother--I 1 must 1 write 1 some 1 letters,\u201d 1 and 1 went 1 up 1 to 1 her 1 room. 1 Then 1 she 1 prepared 1 for 1 action. 1 Love 1 felt 1 and 1 returned, 1 love 1 which 1 our 1 bodies 1 exact 1 and 1 our 1 hearts 1 have 1 transfigured, 1 love 1 which 1 is 1 the 1 most 1 real 1 thing 1 that 1 we 1 shall 1 ever 1 meet, 1 reappeared 1 now 1 as 1 the 1 world\u2019s 1 enemy, 1 and 1 she 1 must 1 stifle 1 it. 1 She 1 sent 1 for 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 The 1 contest 1 lay 1 not 1 between 1 love 1 and 1 duty. 1 Perhaps 1 there 1 never 1 is 1 such 1 a 1 contest. 1 It 1 lay 1 between 1 the 1 real 1 and 1 the 1 pretended, 1 and 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 first 1 aim 1 was 1 to 1 defeat 1 herself. 1 As 1 her 1 brain 1 clouded 1 over, 1 as 1 the 1 memory 1 of 1 the 1 views 1 grew 1 dim 1 and 1 the 1 words 1 of 1 the 1 book 1 died 1 away, 1 she 1 returned 1 to 1 her 1 old 1 shibboleth 1 of 1 nerves. 1 She 1 \u201cconquered 1 her 1 breakdown.\u201d 1 Tampering 1 with 1 the 1 truth, 1 she 1 forgot 1 that 1 the 1 truth 1 had 1 ever 1 been. 1 Remembering 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 engaged 1 to 1 Cecil, 1 she 1 compelled 1 herself 1 to 1 confused 1 remembrances 1 of 1 George; 1 he 1 was 1 nothing 1 to 1 her; 1 he 1 never 1 had 1 been 1 anything; 1 he 1 had 1 behaved 1 abominably; 1 she 1 had 1 never 1 encouraged 1 him. 1 The 1 armour 1 of 1 falsehood 1 is 1 subtly 1 wrought 1 out 1 of 1 darkness, 1 and 1 hides 1 a 1 man 1 not 1 only 1 from 1 others, 1 but 1 from 1 his 1 own 1 soul. 1 In 1 a 1 few 1 moments 1 Lucy 1 was 1 equipped 1 for 1 battle. 1 \u201cSomething 1 too 1 awful 1 has 1 happened,\u201d 1 she 1 began, 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 her 1 cousin 1 arrived. 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 know 1 anything 1 about 1 Miss 1 Lavish\u2019s 1 novel?\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 looked 1 surprised, 1 and 1 said 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 read 1 the 1 book, 1 nor 1 known 1 that 1 it 1 was 1 published; 1 Eleanor 1 was 1 a 1 reticent 1 woman 1 at 1 heart. 1 \u201cThere 1 is 1 a 1 scene 1 in 1 it. 1 The 1 hero 1 and 1 heroine 1 make 1 love. 1 Do 1 you 1 know 1 about 1 that?\u201d 1 \u201cDear--?\u201d 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 know 1 about 1 it, 1 please?\u201d 1 she 1 repeated. 1 \u201cThey 1 are 1 on 1 a 1 hillside, 1 and 1 Florence 1 is 1 in 1 the 1 distance.\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 good 1 Lucia, 1 I 1 am 1 all 1 at 1 sea. 1 I 1 know 1 nothing 1 about 1 it 1 whatever.\u201d 1 \u201cThere 1 are 1 violets. 1 I 1 cannot 1 believe 1 it 1 is 1 a 1 coincidence. 1 Charlotte, 1 Charlotte, 1 how 1 could 1 you 1 have 1 told 1 her? 1 I 1 have 1 thought 1 before 1 speaking; 1 it 1 must 1 be 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cTold 1 her 1 what?\u201d 1 she 1 asked, 1 with 1 growing 1 agitation. 1 \u201cAbout 1 that 1 dreadful 1 afternoon 1 in 1 February.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 genuinely 1 moved. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Lucy, 1 dearest 1 girl--she 1 hasn\u2019t 1 put 1 that 1 in 1 her 1 book?\u201d 1 Lucy 1 nodded. 1 \u201cNot 1 so 1 that 1 one 1 could 1 recognize 1 it. 1 Yes.\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 never--never--never 1 more 1 shall 1 Eleanor 1 Lavish 1 be 1 a 1 friend 1 of 1 mine.\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 you 1 did 1 tell?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 did 1 just 1 happen--when 1 I 1 had 1 tea 1 with 1 her 1 at 1 Rome--in 1 the 1 course 1 of 1 conversation--\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 Charlotte--what 1 about 1 the 1 promise 1 you 1 gave 1 me 1 when 1 we 1 were 1 packing? 1 Why 1 did 1 you 1 tell 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 when 1 you 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 even 1 let 1 me 1 tell 1 mother?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 will 1 never 1 forgive 1 Eleanor. 1 She 1 has 1 betrayed 1 my 1 confidence.\u201d 1 \u201cWhy 1 did 1 you 1 tell 1 her, 1 though? 1 This 1 is 1 a 1 most 1 serious 1 thing.\u201d 1 Why 1 does 1 any 1 one 1 tell 1 anything? 1 The 1 question 1 is 1 eternal, 1 and 1 it 1 was 1 not 1 surprising 1 that 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 should 1 only 1 sigh 1 faintly 1 in 1 response. 1 She 1 had 1 done 1 wrong--she 1 admitted 1 it, 1 she 1 only 1 hoped 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 done 1 harm; 1 she 1 had 1 told 1 Eleanor 1 in 1 the 1 strictest 1 confidence. 1 Lucy 1 stamped 1 with 1 irritation. 1 \u201cCecil 1 happened 1 to 1 read 1 out 1 the 1 passage 1 aloud 1 to 1 me 1 and 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Emerson; 1 it 1 upset 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 and 1 he 1 insulted 1 me 1 again. 1 Behind 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 back. 1 Ugh! 1 Is 1 it 1 possible 1 that 1 men 1 are 1 such 1 brutes? 1 Behind 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 back 1 as 1 we 1 were 1 walking 1 up 1 the 1 garden.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 burst 1 into 1 self-accusations 1 and 1 regrets. 1 \u201cWhat 1 is 1 to 1 be 1 done 1 now? 1 Can 1 you 1 tell 1 me?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Lucy--I 1 shall 1 never 1 forgive 1 myself, 1 never 1 to 1 my 1 dying 1 day. 1 Fancy 1 if 1 your 1 prospects--\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 know,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 wincing 1 at 1 the 1 word. 1 \u201cI 1 see 1 now 1 why 1 you 1 wanted 1 me 1 to 1 tell 1 Cecil, 1 and 1 what 1 you 1 meant 1 by 1 \u2018some 1 other 1 source.\u2019 1 You 1 knew 1 that 1 you 1 had 1 told 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 and 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 reliable.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 turn 1 to 1 wince. 1 \u201cHowever,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 girl, 1 despising 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 shiftiness, 1 \u201cWhat\u2019s 1 done\u2019s 1 done. 1 You 1 have 1 put 1 me 1 in 1 a 1 most 1 awkward 1 position. 1 How 1 am 1 I 1 to 1 get 1 out 1 of 1 it?\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 could 1 not 1 think. 1 The 1 days 1 of 1 her 1 energy 1 were 1 over. 1 She 1 was 1 a 1 visitor, 1 not 1 a 1 chaperon, 1 and 1 a 1 discredited 1 visitor 1 at 1 that. 1 She 1 stood 1 with 1 clasped 1 hands 1 while 1 the 1 girl 1 worked 1 herself 1 into 1 the 1 necessary 1 rage. 1 \u201cHe 1 must--that 1 man 1 must 1 have 1 such 1 a 1 setting 1 down 1 that 1 he 1 won\u2019t 1 forget. 1 And 1 who\u2019s 1 to 1 give 1 it 1 him? 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 tell 1 mother 1 now--owing 1 to 1 you. 1 Nor 1 Cecil, 1 Charlotte, 1 owing 1 to 1 you. 1 I 1 am 1 caught 1 up 1 every 1 way. 1 I 1 think 1 I 1 shall 1 go 1 mad. 1 I 1 have 1 no 1 one 1 to 1 help 1 me. 1 That\u2019s 1 why 1 I\u2019ve 1 sent 1 for 1 you. 1 What\u2019s 1 wanted 1 is 1 a 1 man 1 with 1 a 1 whip.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 agreed: 1 one 1 wanted 1 a 1 man 1 with 1 a 1 whip. 1 \u201cYes--but 1 it\u2019s 1 no 1 good 1 agreeing. 1 What\u2019s 1 to 1 be 1 DONE. 1 We 1 women 1 go 1 maundering 1 on. 1 What 1 DOES 1 a 1 girl 1 do 1 when 1 she 1 comes 1 across 1 a 1 cad?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 always 1 said 1 he 1 was 1 a 1 cad, 1 dear. 1 Give 1 me 1 credit 1 for 1 that, 1 at 1 all 1 events. 1 From 1 the 1 very 1 first 1 moment--when 1 he 1 said 1 his 1 father 1 was 1 having 1 a 1 bath.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 bother 1 the 1 credit 1 and 1 who\u2019s 1 been 1 right 1 or 1 wrong! 1 We\u2019ve 1 both 1 made 1 a 1 muddle 1 of 1 it. 1 George 1 Emerson 1 is 1 still 1 down 1 the 1 garden 1 there, 1 and 1 is 1 he 1 to 1 be 1 left 1 unpunished, 1 or 1 isn\u2019t 1 he? 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 know.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 absolutely 1 helpless. 1 Her 1 own 1 exposure 1 had 1 unnerved 1 her, 1 and 1 thoughts 1 were 1 colliding 1 painfully 1 in 1 her 1 brain. 1 She 1 moved 1 feebly 1 to 1 the 1 window, 1 and 1 tried 1 to 1 detect 1 the 1 cad\u2019s 1 white 1 flannels 1 among 1 the 1 laurels. 1 \u201cYou 1 were 1 ready 1 enough 1 at 1 the 1 Bertolini 1 when 1 you 1 rushed 1 me 1 off 1 to 1 Rome. 1 Can\u2019t 1 you 1 speak 1 again 1 to 1 him 1 now?\u201d 1 \u201cWillingly 1 would 1 I 1 move 1 heaven 1 and 1 earth--\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 want 1 something 1 more 1 definite,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 contemptuously. 1 \u201cWill 1 you 1 speak 1 to 1 him? 1 It 1 is 1 the 1 least 1 you 1 can 1 do, 1 surely, 1 considering 1 it 1 all 1 happened 1 because 1 you 1 broke 1 your 1 word.\u201d 1 \u201cNever 1 again 1 shall 1 Eleanor 1 Lavish 1 be 1 a 1 friend 1 of 1 mine.\u201d 1 Really, 1 Charlotte 1 was 1 outdoing 1 herself. 1 \u201cYes 1 or 1 no, 1 please; 1 yes 1 or 1 no.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 the 1 kind 1 of 1 thing 1 that 1 only 1 a 1 gentleman 1 can 1 settle.\u201d 1 George 1 Emerson 1 was 1 coming 1 up 1 the 1 garden 1 with 1 a 1 tennis 1 ball 1 in 1 his 1 hand. 1 \u201cVery 1 well,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 with 1 an 1 angry 1 gesture. 1 \u201cNo 1 one 1 will 1 help 1 me. 1 I 1 will 1 speak 1 to 1 him 1 myself.\u201d 1", "0", "53519"], "mapper-1-file-output": ["all 1-file1.txt rose 1-file1.txt the 1-file1.txt voice 1-file1.txt of 1-file1.txt the 1-file1.txt clever 1-file1.txt lady,

Bartlett, 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 he 1 had 1 gone. 1 \u201cHow 1 angry 1 he 1 is 1 with 1 his 1 father 1 about 1 the 1 rooms! 1 It 1 is 1 all 1 he 1 can 1 do 1 to 1 keep 1 polite.\u201d 1 \u201cIn 1 half 1 an 1 hour 1 or 1 so 1 your 1 rooms 1 will 1 be 1 ready,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 Then 1 looking 1 rather 1 thoughtfully 1 at 1 the 1 two 1 cousins, 1 he 1 retired 1 to 1 his 1 own 1 rooms, 1 to 1 write 1 up 1 his 1 philosophic 1 diary. 1 \u201cOh, 1 dear!\u201d 1 breathed 1 the 1 little 1 old 1 lady, 1 and 1 shuddered 1 as 1 if 1 all 1 the 1 winds 1 of 1 heaven 1 had 1 entered 1 the 1 apartment. 1 \u201cGentlemen 1 sometimes 1 do 1 not 1 realize--\u201d 1 Her 1 voice 1 faded 1 away, 1 but 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 seemed 1 to 1 understand 1 and 1 a 1 conversation 1 developed, 1 in 1 which 1 gentlemen 1 who 1 did 1 not 1 thoroughly 1 realize 1 played 1 a 1 principal 1 part. 1 Lucy, 1 not 1 realizing 1 either, 1 was 1 reduced 1 to 1 literature. 1 Taking 1 up 1 Baedeker\u2019s 1 Handbook 1 to 1 Northern 1 Italy, 1 she 1 committed 1 to 1 memory 1 the 1 most 1 important 1 dates 1 of 1 Florentine 1 History. 1 For 1 she 1 was 1 determined 1 to 1 enjoy 1 herself 1 on 1 the 1 morrow. 1 Thus 1 the 1 half-hour 1 crept 1 profitably 1 away, 1 and 1 at 1 last 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 rose 1 with 1 a 1 sigh, 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 one 1 might 1 venture 1 now. 1 No, 1 Lucy, 1 do 1 not 1 stir. 1 I 1 will 1 superintend 1 the 1 move.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 you 1 do 1 do 1 everything,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cNaturally, 1 dear. 1 It 1 is 1 my 1 affair.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 I 1 would 1 like 1 to 1 help 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 dear.\u201d 1 Charlotte\u2019s 1 energy! 1 And 1 her 1 unselfishness! 1 She 1 had 1 been 1 thus 1 all 1 her 1 life, 1 but 1 really, 1 on 1 this 1 Italian 1 tour, 1 she 1 was 1 surpassing 1 herself. 1 So 1 Lucy 1 felt, 1 or 1 strove 1 to 1 feel. 1 And 1 yet--there 1 was 1 a 1 rebellious 1 spirit 1 in 1 her 1 which 1 wondered 1 whether 1 the 1 acceptance 1 might 1 not 1 have 1 been 1 less 1 delicate 1 and 1 more 1 beautiful. 1 At 1 all 1 events, 1 she 1 entered 1 her 1 own 1 room 1 without 1 any 1 feeling 1 of 1 joy. 1 \u201cI 1 want 1 to 1 explain,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 \u201cwhy 1 it 1 is 1 that 1 I 1 have 1 taken 1 the 1 largest 1 room. 1 Naturally, 1 of 1 course, 1 I 1 should 1 have 1 given 1 it 1 to 1 you; 1 but 1 I 1 happen 1 to 1 know 1 that 1 it 1 belongs 1 to 1 the 1 young 1 man, 1 and 1 I 1 was 1 sure 1 your 1 mother 1 would 1 not 1 like 1 it.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 was 1 bewildered. 1 \u201cIf 1 you 1 are 1 to 1 accept 1 a 1 favour 1 it 1 is 1 more 1 suitable 1 you 1 should 1 be 1 under 1 an 1 obligation 1 to 1 his 1 father 1 than 1 to 1 him. 1 I 1 am 1 a 1 woman 1 of 1 the 1 world, 1 in 1 my 1 small 1 way, 1 and 1 I 1 know 1 where 1 things 1 lead 1 to. 1 However, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 is 1 a 1 guarantee 1 of 1 a 1 sort 1 that 1 they 1 will 1 not 1 presume 1 on 1 this.\u201d 1 \u201cMother 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 mind 1 I\u2019m 1 sure,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 but 1 again 1 had 1 the 1 sense 1 of 1 larger 1 and 1 unsuspected 1 issues. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 only 1 sighed, 1 and 1 enveloped 1 her 1 in 1 a 1 protecting 1 embrace 1 as 1 she 1 wished 1 her 1 good-night. 1 It 1 gave 1 Lucy 1 the 1 sensation 1 of 1 a 1 fog, 1 and 1 when 1 she 1 reached 1 her 1 own 1 room 1 she 1 opened 1 the 1 window 1 and 1 breathed 1 the 1 clean 1 night 1 air, 1 thinking 1 of 1 the 1 kind 1 old 1 man 1 who 1 had 1 enabled 1 her 1 to 1 see 1 the 1 lights 1 dancing 1 in 1 the 1 Arno 1 and 1 the 1 cypresses 1 of 1 San 1 Miniato, 1 and 1 the 1 foot-hills 1 of 1 the 1 Apennines, 1 black 1 against 1 the 1 rising 1 moon. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 in 1 her 1 room, 1 fastened 1 the 1 window-shutters 1 and 1 locked 1 the 1 door, 1 and 1 then 1 made 1 a 1 tour 1 of 1 the 1 apartment 1 to 1 see 1 where 1 the 1 cupboards 1 led, 1 and 1 whether 1 there 1 were 1 any 1 oubliettes 1 or 1 secret 1 entrances. 1 It 1 was 1 then 1 that 1 she 1 saw, 1 pinned 1 up 1 over 1 the 1 washstand, 1 a 1 sheet 1 of 1 paper 1 on 1 which 1 was 1 scrawled 1 an 1 enormous 1 note 1 of 1 interrogation. 1 Nothing 1 more. 1 \u201cWhat 1 does 1 it 1 mean?\u201d 1 she 1 thought, 1 and 1 she 1 examined 1 it 1 carefully 1 by 1 the 1 light 1 of 1 a 1 candle. 1 Meaningless 1 at 1 first, 1 it 1 gradually 1 became 1 menacing, 1 obnoxious, 1 portentous 1 with 1 evil. 1 She 1 was 1 seized 1 with 1 an 1 impulse 1 to 1 destroy 1 it, 1 but 1 fortunately 1 remembered 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 no 1 right 1 to 1 do 1 so, 1 since 1 it 1 must 1 be 1 the 1 property 1 of 1 young 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 So 1 she 1 unpinned 1 it 1 carefully, 1 and 1 put 1 it 1 between 1 two 1 pieces 1 of 1 blotting-paper 1 to 1 keep 1 it 1 clean 1 for 1 him. 1 Then 1 she 1 completed 1 her 1 inspection 1 of 1 the 1 room, 1 sighed 1 heavily 1 according 1 to 1 her 1 habit, 1 and 1 went 1 to 1 bed. 1 Chapter 1 II: 1 In 1 Santa 1 Croce 1 with 1 No 1 Baedeker 1 It 1 was 1 pleasant 1 to 1 wake 1 up 1 in 1 Florence, 1 to 1 open 1 the 1 eyes 1 upon 1 a 1 bright 1 bare 1 room, 1 with 1 a 1 floor 1 of 1 red 1 tiles 1 which 1 look 1 clean 1 though 1 they 1 are 1 not; 1 with 1 a 1 painted 1 ceiling 1 whereon 1 pink 1 griffins 1 and 1 blue 1 amorini 1 sport 1 in 1 a 1 forest 1 of 1 yellow 1 violins 1 and 1 bassoons. 1 It 1 was 1 pleasant, 1 too, 1 to 1 fling 1 wide 1 the 1 windows, 1 pinching 1 the 1 fingers 1 in 1 unfamiliar 1 fastenings, 1 to 1 lean 1 out 1 into 1 sunshine 1 with 1 beautiful 1 hills 1 and 1 trees 1 and 1 marble 1 churches 1 opposite, 1 and 1 close 1 below, 1 the 1 Arno, 1 gurgling 1 against 1 the 1 embankment 1 of 1 the 1 road. 1 Over 1 the 1 river 1 men 1 were 1 at 1 work 1 with 1 spades 1 and 1 sieves 1 on 1 the 1 sandy 1 foreshore, 1 and 1 on 1 the 1 river 1 was 1 a 1 boat, 1 also 1 diligently 1 employed 1 for 1 some 1 mysterious 1 end. 1 An 1 electric 1 tram 1 came 1 rushing 1 underneath 1 the 1 window. 1 No 1 one 1 was 1 inside 1 it, 1 except 1 one 1 tourist; 1 but 1 its 1 platforms 1 were 1 overflowing 1 with 1 Italians, 1 who 1 preferred 1 to 1 stand. 1 Children 1 tried 1 to 1 hang 1 on 1 behind, 1 and 1 the 1 conductor, 1 with 1 no 1 malice, 1 spat 1 in 1 their 1 faces 1 to 1 make 1 them 1 let 1 go. 1 Then 1 soldiers 1 appeared--good-looking, 1 undersized 1 men--wearing 1 each 1 a 1 knapsack 1 covered 1 with 1 mangy 1 fur, 1 and 1 a 1 great-coat 1 which 1 had 1 been 1 cut 1 for 1 some 1 larger 1 soldier. 1 Beside 1 them 1 walked 1 officers, 1 looking 1 foolish 1 and 1 fierce, 1 and 1 before 1 them 1 went 1 little 1 boys, 1 turning 1 somersaults 1 in 1 time 1 with 1 the 1 band. 1 The 1 tramcar 1 became 1 entangled 1 in 1 their 1 ranks, 1 and 1 moved 1 on 1 painfully, 1 like 1 a 1 caterpillar 1 in 1 a 1 swarm 1 of 1 ants. 1 One 1 of 1 the 1 little 1 boys 1 fell 1 down, 1 and 1 some 1 white 1 bullocks 1 came 1 out 1 of 1 an 1 archway. 1 Indeed, 1 if 1 it 1 had 1 not 1 been 1 for 1 the 1 good 1 advice 1 of 1 an 1 old 1 man 1 who 1 was 1 selling 1 button-hooks, 1 the 1 road 1 might 1 never 1 have 1 got 1 clear. 1 Over 1 such 1 trivialities 1 as 1 these 1 many 1 a 1 valuable 1 hour 1 may 1 slip 1 away, 1 and 1 the 1 traveller 1 who 1 has 1 gone 1 to 1 Italy 1 to 1 study 1 the 1 tactile 1 values 1 of 1 Giotto, 1 or 1 the 1 corruption 1 of 1 the 1 Papacy, 1 may 1 return 1 remembering 1 nothing 1 but 1 the 1 blue 1 sky 1 and 1 the 1 men 1 and 1 women 1 who 1 live 1 under 1 it. 1 So 1 it 1 was 1 as 1 well 1 that 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 should 1 tap 1 and 1 come 1 in, 1 and 1 having 1 commented 1 on 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 leaving 1 the 1 door 1 unlocked, 1 and 1 on 1 her 1 leaning 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 window 1 before 1 she 1 was 1 fully 1 dressed, 1 should 1 urge 1 her 1 to 1 hasten 1 herself, 1 or 1 the 1 best 1 of 1 the 1 day 1 would 1 be 1 gone. 1 By 1 the 1 time 1 Lucy 1 was 1 ready 1 her 1 cousin 1 had 1 done 1 her 1 breakfast, 1 and 1 was 1 listening 1 to 1 the 1 clever 1 lady 1 among 1 the 1 crumbs. 1 A 1 conversation 1 then 1 ensued, 1 on 1 not 1 unfamiliar 1 lines. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was, 1 after 1 all, 1 a 1 wee 1 bit 1 tired, 1 and 1 thought 1 they 1 had 1 better 1 spend 1 the 1 morning 1 settling 1 in; 1 unless 1 Lucy 1 would 1 at 1 all 1 like 1 to 1 go 1 out? 1 Lucy 1 would 1 rather 1 like 1 to 1 go 1 out, 1 as 1 it 1 was 1 her 1 first 1 day 1 in 1 Florence, 1 but, 1 of 1 course, 1 she 1 could 1 go 1 alone. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 could 1 not 1 allow 1 this. 1 Of 1 course 1 she 1 would 1 accompany 1 Lucy 1 everywhere. 1 Oh, 1 certainly 1 not; 1 Lucy 1 would 1 stop 1 with 1 her 1 cousin. 1 Oh, 1 no! 1 that 1 would 1 never 1 do. 1 Oh, 1 yes! 1 At 1 this 1 point 1 the 1 clever 1 lady 1 broke 1 in. 1 \u201cIf 1 it 1 is 1 Mrs. 1 Grundy 1 who 1 is 1 troubling 1 you, 1 I 1 do 1 assure 1 you 1 that 1 you 1 can 1 neglect 1 the 1 good 1 person. 1 Being 1 English, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 will 1 be 1 perfectly 1 safe. 1 Italians 1 understand. 1 A 1 dear 1 friend 1 of 1 mine, 1 Contessa 1 Baroncelli, 1 has 1 two 1 daughters, 1 and 1 when 1 she 1 cannot 1 send 1 a 1 maid 1 to 1 school 1 with 1 them, 1 she 1 lets 1 them 1 go 1 in 1 sailor-hats 1 instead. 1 Every 1 one 1 takes 1 them 1 for 1 English, 1 you 1 see, 1 especially 1 if 1 their 1 hair 1 is 1 strained 1 tightly 1 behind.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 unconvinced 1 by 1 the 1 safety 1 of 1 Contessa 1 Baroncelli\u2019s 1 daughters. 1 She 1 was 1 determined 1 to 1 take 1 Lucy 1 herself, 1 her 1 head 1 not 1 being 1 so 1 very 1 bad. 1 The 1 clever 1 lady 1 then 1 said 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 going 1 to 1 spend 1 a 1 long 1 morning 1 in 1 Santa 1 Croce, 1 and 1 if 1 Lucy 1 would 1 come 1 too, 1 she 1 would 1 be 1 delighted. 1 \u201cI 1 will 1 take 1 you 1 by 1 a 1 dear 1 dirty 1 back 1 way, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 and 1 if 1 you 1 bring 1 me 1 luck, 1 we 1 shall 1 have 1 an 1 adventure.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 said 1 that 1 this 1 was 1 most 1 kind, 1 and 1 at 1 once 1 opened 1 the 1 Baedeker, 1 to 1 see 1 where 1 Santa 1 Croce 1 was. 1 \u201cTut, 1 tut! 1 Miss 1 Lucy! 1 I 1 hope 1 we 1 shall 1 soon 1 emancipate 1 you 1 from 1 Baedeker. 1 He 1 does 1 but 1 touch 1 the 1 surface 1 of 1 things. 1 As 1 to 1 the 1 true 1 Italy--he 1 does 1 not 1 even 1 dream 1 of 1 it. 1 The 1 true 1 Italy 1 is 1 only 1 to 1 be 1 found 1 by 1 patient 1 observation.\u201d 1 This 1 sounded 1 very 1 interesting, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 hurried 1 over 1 her 1 breakfast, 1 and 1 started 1 with 1 her 1 new 1 friend 1 in 1 high 1 spirits. 1 Italy 1 was 1 coming 1 at 1 last. 1 The 1 Cockney 1 Signora 1 and 1 her 1 works 1 had 1 vanished 1 like 1 a 1 bad 1 dream. 1 Miss 1 Lavish--for 1 that 1 was 1 the 1 clever 1 lady\u2019s 1 name--turned 1 to 1 the 1 right 1 along 1 the 1 sunny 1 Lung\u2019 1 Arno. 1 How 1 delightfully 1 warm! 1 But 1 a 1 wind 1 down 1 the 1 side 1 streets 1 cut 1 like 1 a 1 knife, 1 didn\u2019t 1 it? 1 Ponte 1 alle 1 Grazie--particularly 1 interesting, 1 mentioned 1 by 1 Dante. 1 San 1 Miniato--beautiful 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 interesting; 1 the 1 crucifix 1 that 1 kissed 1 a 1 murderer--Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 would 1 remember 1 the 1 story. 1 The 1 men 1 on 1 the 1 river 1 were 1 fishing. 1 (Untrue; 1 but 1 then, 1 so 1 is 1 most 1 information.) 1 Then 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 darted 1 under 1 the 1 archway 1 of 1 the 1 white 1 bullocks, 1 and 1 she 1 stopped, 1 and 1 she 1 cried: 1 \u201cA 1 smell! 1 a 1 true 1 Florentine 1 smell! 1 Every 1 city, 1 let 1 me 1 teach 1 you, 1 has 1 its 1 own 1 smell.\u201d 1 \u201cIs 1 it 1 a 1 very 1 nice 1 smell?\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 had 1 inherited 1 from 1 her 1 mother 1 a 1 distaste 1 to 1 dirt. 1 \u201cOne 1 doesn\u2019t 1 come 1 to 1 Italy 1 for 1 niceness,\u201d 1 was 1 the 1 retort; 1 \u201cone 1 comes 1 for 1 life. 1 Buon 1 giorno! 1 Buon 1 giorno!\u201d 1 bowing 1 right 1 and 1 left. 1 \u201cLook 1 at 1 that 1 adorable 1 wine-cart! 1 How 1 the 1 driver 1 stares 1 at 1 us, 1 dear, 1 simple 1 soul!\u201d 1 So 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 proceeded 1 through 1 the 1 streets 1 of 1 the 1 city 1 of 1 Florence, 1 short, 1 fidgety, 1 and 1 playful 1 as 1 a 1 kitten, 1 though 1 without 1 a 1 kitten\u2019s 1 grace. 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 treat 1 for 1 the 1 girl 1 to 1 be 1 with 1 any 1 one 1 so 1 clever 1 and 1 so 1 cheerful; 1 and 1 a 1 blue 1 military 1 cloak, 1 such 1 as 1 an 1 Italian 1 officer 1 wears, 1 only 1 increased 1 the 1 sense 1 of 1 festivity. 1 \u201cBuon 1 giorno! 1 Take 1 the 1 word 1 of 1 an 1 old 1 woman, 1 Miss 1 Lucy: 1 you 1 will 1 never 1 repent 1 of 1 a 1 little 1 civility 1 to 1 your 1 inferiors. 1 That 1 is 1 the 1 true 1 democracy. 1 Though 1 I 1 am 1 a 1 real 1 Radical 1 as 1 well. 1 There, 1 now 1 you\u2019re 1 shocked.\u201d 1 \u201cIndeed, 1 I\u2019m 1 not!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cWe 1 are 1 Radicals, 1 too, 1 out 1 and 1 out. 1 My 1 father 1 always 1 voted 1 for 1 Mr. 1 Gladstone, 1 until 1 he 1 was 1 so 1 dreadful 1 about 1 Ireland.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 see, 1 I 1 see. 1 And 1 now 1 you 1 have 1 gone 1 over 1 to 1 the 1 enemy.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 please--! 1 If 1 my 1 father 1 was 1 alive, 1 I 1 am 1 sure 1 he 1 would 1 vote 1 Radical 1 again 1 now 1 that 1 Ireland 1 is 1 all 1 right. 1 And 1 as 1 it 1 is, 1 the 1 glass 1 over 1 our 1 front 1 door 1 was 1 broken 1 last 1 election, 1 and 1 Freddy 1 is 1 sure 1 it 1 was 1 the 1 Tories; 1 but 1 mother 1 says 1 nonsense, 1 a 1 tramp.\u201d 1 \u201cShameful! 1 A 1 manufacturing 1 district, 1 I 1 suppose?\u201d 1 \u201cNo--in 1 the 1 Surrey 1 hills. 1 About 1 five 1 miles 1 from 1 Dorking, 1 looking 1 over 1 the 1 Weald.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 seemed 1 interested, 1 and 1 slackened 1 her 1 trot. 1 \u201cWhat 1 a 1 delightful 1 part; 1 I 1 know 1 it 1 so 1 well. 1 Of 1 course 1 it 1 was 1 the 1 railway!\u201d 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 control 1 her 1 mirth. 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 the 1 image 1 of 1 a 1 porter--on, 1 on 1 the 1 South-Eastern.\u201d 1 \u201cEleanor, 1 be 1 quiet,\u201d 1 plucking 1 at 1 her 1 vivacious 1 companion. 1 \u201cHush! 1 They\u2019ll 1 hear--the 1 Emersons--\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 stop. 1 Let 1 me 1 go 1 my 1 wicked 1 way. 1 A 1 porter--\u201d 1 \u201cEleanor!\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 sure 1 it\u2019s 1 all 1 right,\u201d 1 put 1 in 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cThe 1 Emersons 1 won\u2019t 1 hear, 1 and 1 they 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 mind 1 if 1 they 1 did.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 did 1 not 1 seem 1 pleased 1 at 1 this. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch 1 listening!\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 rather 1 crossly. 1 \u201cPouf! 1 Wouf! 1 You 1 naughty 1 girl! 1 Go 1 away!\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Lucy, 1 you 1 ought 1 to 1 be 1 with 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 I\u2019m 1 sure.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 find 1 them 1 now, 1 and 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 want 1 to 1 either.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Eager 1 will 1 be 1 offended. 1 It 1 is 1 your 1 party.\u201d 1 \u201cPlease, 1 I\u2019d 1 rather 1 stop 1 here 1 with 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 agree,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Lavish. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 like 1 a 1 school 1 feast; 1 the 1 boys 1 have 1 got 1 separated 1 from 1 the 1 girls. 1 Miss 1 Lucy, 1 you 1 are 1 to 1 go. 1 We 1 wish 1 to 1 converse 1 on 1 high 1 topics 1 unsuited 1 for 1 your 1 ear.\u201d 1 The 1 girl 1 was 1 stubborn. 1 As 1 her 1 time 1 at 1 Florence 1 drew 1 to 1 its 1 close 1 she 1 was 1 only 1 at 1 ease 1 amongst 1 those 1 to 1 whom 1 she 1 felt 1 indifferent. 1 Such 1 a 1 one 1 was 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 and 1 such 1 for 1 the 1 moment 1 was 1 Charlotte. 1 She 1 wished 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 called 1 attention 1 to 1 herself; 1 they 1 were 1 both 1 annoyed 1 at 1 her 1 remark 1 and 1 seemed 1 determined 1 to 1 get 1 rid 1 of 1 her. 1 \u201cHow 1 tired 1 one 1 gets,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cOh, 1 I 1 do 1 wish 1 Freddy 1 and 1 your 1 mother 1 could 1 be 1 here.\u201d 1 Unselfishness 1 with 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 entirely 1 usurped 1 the 1 functions 1 of 1 enthusiasm. 1 Lucy 1 did 1 not 1 look 1 at 1 the 1 view 1 either. 1 She 1 would 1 not 1 enjoy 1 anything 1 till 1 she 1 was 1 safe 1 at 1 Rome. 1 \u201cThen 1 sit 1 you 1 down,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Lavish. 1 \u201cObserve 1 my 1 foresight.\u201d 1 With 1 many 1 a 1 smile 1 she 1 produced 1 two 1 of 1 those 1 mackintosh 1 squares 1 that 1 protect 1 the 1 frame 1 of 1 the 1 tourist 1 from 1 damp 1 grass 1 or 1 cold 1 marble 1 steps. 1 She 1 sat 1 on 1 one; 1 who 1 was 1 to 1 sit 1 on 1 the 1 other? 1 \u201cLucy; 1 without 1 a 1 moment\u2019s 1 doubt, 1 Lucy. 1 The 1 ground 1 will 1 do 1 for 1 me. 1 Really 1 I 1 have 1 not 1 had 1 rheumatism 1 for 1 years. 1 If 1 I 1 do 1 feel 1 it 1 coming 1 on 1 I 1 shall 1 stand. 1 Imagine 1 your 1 mother\u2019s 1 feelings 1 if 1 I 1 let 1 you 1 sit 1 in 1 the 1 wet 1 in 1 your 1 white 1 linen.\u201d 1 She 1 sat 1 down 1 heavily 1 where 1 the 1 ground 1 looked 1 particularly 1 moist. 1 \u201cHere 1 we 1 are, 1 all 1 settled 1 delightfully. 1 Even 1 if 1 my 1 dress 1 is 1 thinner 1 it 1 will 1 not 1 show 1 so 1 much, 1 being 1 brown. 1 Sit 1 down, 1 dear; 1 you 1 are 1 too 1 unselfish; 1 you 1 don\u2019t 1 assert 1 yourself 1 enough.\u201d 1 She 1 cleared 1 her 1 throat. 1 \u201cNow 1 don\u2019t 1 be 1 alarmed; 1 this 1 isn\u2019t 1 a 1 cold. 1 It\u2019s 1 the 1 tiniest 1 cough, 1 and 1 I 1 have 1 had 1 it 1 three 1 days. 1 It\u2019s 1 nothing 1 to 1 do 1 with 1 sitting 1 here 1 at 1 all.\u201d 1 There 1 was 1 only 1 one 1 way 1 of 1 treating 1 the 1 situation. 1 At 1 the 1 end 1 of 1 five 1 minutes 1 Lucy 1 departed 1 in 1 search 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 vanquished 1 by 1 the 1 mackintosh 1 square. 1 She 1 addressed 1 herself 1 to 1 the 1 drivers, 1 who 1 were 1 sprawling 1 in 1 the 1 carriages, 1 perfuming 1 the 1 cushions 1 with 1 cigars. 1 The 1 miscreant, 1 a 1 bony 1 young 1 man 1 scorched 1 black 1 by 1 the 1 sun, 1 rose 1 to 1 greet 1 her 1 with 1 the 1 courtesy 1 of 1 a 1 host 1 and 1 the 1 assurance 1 of 1 a 1 relative. 1 \u201cDove?\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 after 1 much 1 anxious 1 thought. 1 His 1 face 1 lit 1 up. 1 Of 1 course 1 he 1 knew 1 where. 1 Not 1 so 1 far 1 either. 1 His 1 arm 1 swept 1 three-fourths 1 of 1 the 1 horizon. 1 He 1 should 1 just 1 think 1 he 1 did 1 know 1 where. 1 He 1 pressed 1 his 1 finger-tips 1 to 1 his 1 forehead 1 and 1 then 1 pushed 1 them 1 towards 1 her, 1 as 1 if 1 oozing 1 with 1 visible 1 extract 1 of 1 knowledge. 1 More 1 seemed 1 necessary. 1 What 1 was 1 the 1 Italian 1 for 1 \u201cclergyman\u201d? 1 \u201cDove 1 buoni 1 uomini?\u201d 1 said 1 she 1 at 1 last. 1 Good? 1 Scarcely 1 the 1 adjective 1 for 1 those 1 noble 1 beings! 1 He 1 showed 1 her 1 his 1 cigar. 1 \u201cUno--piu--piccolo,\u201d 1 was 1 her 1 next 1 remark, 1 implying 1 \u201cHas 1 the 1 cigar 1 been 1 given 1 to 1 you 1 by 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 the 1 smaller 1 of 1 the 1 two 1 good 1 men?\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 correct 1 as 1 usual. 1 He 1 tied 1 the 1 horse 1 to 1 a 1 tree, 1 kicked 1 it 1 to 1 make 1 it 1 stay 1 quiet, 1 dusted 1 the 1 carriage, 1 arranged 1 his 1 hair, 1 remoulded 1 his 1 hat, 1 encouraged 1 his 1 moustache, 1 and 1 in 1 rather 1 less 1 than 1 a 1 quarter 1 of 1 a 1 minute 1 was 1 ready 1 to 1 conduct 1 her. 1 Italians 1 are 1 born 1 knowing 1 the 1 way. 1 It 1 would 1 seem 1 that 1 the 1 whole 1 earth 1 lay 1 before 1 them, 1 not 1 as 1 a 1 map, 1 but 1 as 1 a 1 chess-board, 1 whereon 1 they 1 continually 1 behold 1 the 1 changing 1 pieces 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 the 1 squares. 1 Any 1 one 1 can 1 find 1 places, 1 but 1 the 1 finding 1 of 1 people 1 is 1 a 1 gift 1 from 1 God. 1 He 1 only 1 stopped 1 once, 1 to 1 pick 1 her 1 some 1 great 1 blue 1 violets. 1 She 1 thanked 1 him 1 with 1 real 1 pleasure. 1 In 1 the 1 company 1 of 1 this 1 common 1 man 1 the 1 world 1 was 1 beautiful 1 and 1 direct. 1 For 1 the 1 first 1 time 1 she 1 felt 1 the 1 influence 1 of 1 Spring. 1 His 1 arm 1 swept 1 the 1 horizon 1 gracefully; 1 violets, 1 like 1 other 1 things, 1 existed 1 in 1 great 1 profusion 1 there; 1 \u201cwould 1 she 1 like 1 to 1 see 1 them?\u201d 1 \u201cMa 1 buoni 1 uomini.\u201d 1 He 1 bowed. 1 Certainly. 1 Good 1 men 1 first, 1 violets 1 afterwards. 1 They 1 proceeded 1 briskly 1 through 1 the 1 undergrowth, 1 which 1 became 1 thicker 1 and 1 thicker. 1 They 1 were 1 nearing 1 the 1 edge 1 of 1 the 1 promontory, 1 and 1 the 1 view 1 was 1 stealing 1 round 1 them, 1 but 1 the 1 brown 1 network 1 of 1 the 1 bushes 1 shattered 1 it 1 into 1 countless 1 pieces. 1 He 1 was 1 occupied 1 in 1 his 1 cigar, 1 and 1 in 1 holding 1 back 1 the 1 pliant 1 boughs. 1 She 1 was 1 rejoicing 1 in 1 her 1 escape 1 from 1 dullness. 1 Not 1 a 1 step, 1 not 1 a 1 twig, 1 was 1 unimportant 1 to 1 her. 1 \u201cWhat 1 is 1 that?\u201d 1 There 1 was 1 a 1 voice 1 in 1 the 1 wood, 1 in 1 the 1 distance 1 behind 1 them. 1 The 1 voice 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Eager? 1 He 1 shrugged 1 his 1 shoulders. 1 An 1 Italian\u2019s 1 ignorance 1 is 1 sometimes 1 more 1 remarkable 1 than 1 his 1 knowledge. 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 make 1 him 1 understand 1 that 1 perhaps 1 they 1 had 1 missed 1 the 1 clergymen. 1 The 1 view 1 was 1 forming 1 at 1 last; 1 she 1 could 1 discern 1 the 1 river, 1 the 1 golden 1 plain, 1 other 1 hills. 1 \u201cEccolo!\u201d 1 he 1 exclaimed. 1 At 1 the 1 same 1 moment 1 the 1 ground 1 gave 1 way, 1 and 1 with 1 a 1 cry 1 she 1 fell 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 wood. 1 Light 1 and 1 beauty 1 enveloped 1 her. 1 She 1 had 1 fallen 1 on 1 to 1 a 1 little 1 open 1 terrace, 1 which 1 was 1 covered 1 with 1 violets 1 from 1 end 1 to 1 end. 1 \u201cCourage!\u201d 1 cried 1 her 1 companion, 1 now 1 standing 1 some 1 six 1 feet 1 above. 1 \u201cCourage 1 and 1 love.\u201d 1 She 1 did 1 not 1 answer. 1 From 1 her 1 feet 1 the 1 ground 1 sloped 1 sharply 1 into 1 view, 1 and 1 violets 1 ran 1 down 1 in 1 rivulets 1 and 1 streams 1 and 1 cataracts, 1 irrigating 1 the 1 hillside 1 with 1 blue, 1 eddying 1 round 1 the 1 tree 1 stems 1 collecting 1 into 1 pools 1 in 1 the 1 hollows, 1 covering 1 the 1 grass 1 with 1 spots 1 of 1 azure 1 foam. 1 But 1 never 1 again 1 were 1 they 1 in 1 such 1 profusion; 1 this 1 terrace 1 was 1 the 1 well-head, 1 the 1 primal 1 source 1 whence 1 beauty 1 gushed 1 out 1 to 1 water 1 the 1 earth. 1 Standing 1 at 1 its 1 brink, 1 like 1 a 1 swimmer 1 who 1 prepares, 1 was 1 the 1 good 1 man. 1 But 1 he 1 was 1 not 1 the 1 good 1 man 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 expected, 1 and 1 he 1 was 1 alone. 1 George 1 had 1 turned 1 at 1 the 1 sound 1 of 1 her 1 arrival. 1 For 1 a 1 moment 1 he 1 contemplated 1 her, 1 as 1 one 1 who 1 had 1 fallen 1 out 1 of 1 heaven. 1 He 1 saw 1 radiant 1 joy 1 in 1 her 1 face, 1 he 1 saw 1 the 1 flowers 1 beat 1 against 1 her 1 dress 1 in 1 blue 1 waves. 1 The 1 bushes 1 above 1 them 1 closed. 1 He 1 stepped 1 quickly 1 forward 1 and 1 kissed 1 her. 1 Before 1 she 1 could 1 speak, 1 almost 1 before 1 she 1 could 1 feel, 1 a 1 voice 1 called, 1 \u201cLucy! 1 Lucy! 1 Lucy!\u201d 1 The 1 silence 1 of 1 life 1 had 1 been 1 broken 1 by 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 who 1 stood 1 brown 1 against 1 the 1 view. 1 Chapter 1 VII: 1 They 1 Return 1 Some 1 complicated 1 game 1 had 1 been 1 playing 1 up 1 and 1 down 1 the 1 hillside 1 all 1 the 1 afternoon. 1 What 1 it 1 was 1 and 1 exactly 1 how 1 the 1 players 1 had 1 sided, 1 Lucy 1 was 1 slow 1 to 1 discover. 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 had 1 met 1 them 1 with 1 a 1 questioning 1 eye. 1 Charlotte 1 had 1 repulsed 1 him 1 with 1 much 1 small 1 talk. 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 seeking 1 his 1 son, 1 was 1 told 1 whereabouts 1 to 1 find 1 him. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 who 1 wore 1 the 1 heated 1 aspect 1 of 1 a 1 neutral, 1 was 1 bidden 1 to 1 collect 1 the 1 factions 1 for 1 the 1 return 1 home. 1 There 1 was 1 a 1 general 1 sense 1 of 1 groping 1 and 1 bewilderment. 1 Pan 1 had 1 been 1 amongst 1 them--not 1 the 1 great 1 god 1 Pan, 1 who 1 has 1 been 1 buried 1 these 1 two 1 thousand 1 years, 1 but 1 the 1 little 1 god 1 Pan, 1 who 1 presides 1 over 1 social 1 contretemps 1 and 1 unsuccessful 1 picnics. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 had 1 lost 1 everyone, 1 and 1 had 1 consumed 1 in 1 solitude 1 the 1 tea-basket 1 which 1 he 1 had 1 brought 1 up 1 as 1 a 1 pleasant 1 surprise. 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 lost 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 Lucy 1 had 1 lost 1 Mr. 1 Eager. 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 had 1 lost 1 George. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 lost 1 a 1 mackintosh 1 square. 1 Phaethon 1 had 1 lost 1 the 1 game. 1 That 1 last 1 fact 1 was 1 undeniable. 1 He 1 climbed 1 on 1 to 1 the 1 box 1 shivering, 1 with 1 his 1 collar 1 up, 1 prophesying 1 the 1 swift 1 approach 1 of 1 bad 1 weather. 1 \u201cLet 1 us 1 go 1 immediately,\u201d 1 he 1 told 1 them. 1 \u201cThe 1 signorino 1 will 1 walk.\u201d 1 \u201cAll 1 the 1 way? 1 He 1 will 1 be 1 hours,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cApparently. 1 I 1 told 1 him 1 it 1 was 1 unwise.\u201d 1 He 1 would 1 look 1 no 1 one 1 in 1 the 1 face; 1 perhaps 1 defeat 1 was 1 particularly 1 mortifying 1 for 1 him. 1 He 1 alone 1 had 1 played 1 skilfully, 1 using 1 the 1 whole 1 of 1 his 1 instinct, 1 while 1 the 1 others 1 had 1 used 1 scraps 1 of 1 their 1 intelligence. 1 He 1 alone 1 had 1 divined 1 what 1 things 1 were, 1 and 1 what 1 he 1 wished 1 them 1 to 1 be. 1 He 1 alone 1 had 1 interpreted 1 the 1 message 1 that 1 Lucy 1 had 1 received 1 five 1 days 1 before 1 from 1 the 1 lips 1 of 1 a 1 dying 1 man. 1 Persephone, 1 who 1 spends 1 half 1 her 1 life 1 in 1 the 1 grave--she 1 could 1 interpret 1 it 1 also. 1 Not 1 so 1 these 1 English. 1 They 1 gain 1 knowledge 1 slowly, 1 and 1 perhaps 1 too 1 late. 1 The 1 thoughts 1 of 1 a 1 cab-driver, 1 however 1 just, 1 seldom 1 affect 1 the 1 lives 1 of 1 his 1 employers. 1 He 1 was 1 the 1 most 1 competent 1 of 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 opponents, 1 but 1 infinitely 1 the 1 least 1 dangerous. 1 Once 1 back 1 in 1 the 1 town, 1 he 1 and 1 his 1 insight 1 and 1 his 1 knowledge 1 would 1 trouble 1 English 1 ladies 1 no 1 more. 1 Of 1 course, 1 it 1 was 1 most 1 unpleasant; 1 she 1 had 1 seen 1 his 1 black 1 head 1 in 1 the 1 bushes; 1 he 1 might 1 make 1 a 1 tavern 1 story 1 out 1 of 1 it. 1 But 1 after 1 all, 1 what 1 have 1 we 1 to 1 do 1 with 1 taverns? 1 Real 1 menace 1 belongs 1 to 1 the 1 drawing-room. 1 It 1 was 1 of 1 drawing-room 1 people 1 that 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 thought 1 as 1 she 1 journeyed 1 downwards 1 towards 1 the 1 fading 1 sun. 1 Lucy 1 sat 1 beside 1 her; 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 sat 1 opposite, 1 trying 1 to 1 catch 1 her 1 eye; 1 he 1 was 1 vaguely 1 suspicious. 1 They 1 spoke 1 of 1 Alessio 1 Baldovinetti. 1 Rain 1 and 1 darkness 1 came 1 on 1 together. 1 The 1 two 1 ladies 1 huddled 1 together 1 under 1 an 1 inadequate 1 parasol. 1 There 1 was 1 a 1 lightning 1 flash, 1 and 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 who 1 was 1 nervous, 1 screamed 1 from 1 the 1 carriage 1 in 1 front. 1 At 1 the 1 next 1 flash, 1 Lucy 1 screamed 1 also. 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 addressed 1 her 1 professionally: 1 \u201cCourage, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 courage 1 and 1 faith. 1 If 1 I 1 might 1 say 1 so, 1 there 1 is 1 something 1 almost 1 blasphemous 1 in 1 this 1 horror 1 of 1 the 1 elements. 1 Are 1 we 1 seriously 1 to 1 suppose 1 that 1 all 1 these 1 clouds, 1 all 1 this 1 immense 1 electrical 1 display, 1 is 1 simply 1 called 1 into 1 existence 1 to 1 extinguish 1 you 1 or 1 me?\u201d 1 \u201cNo--of 1 course--\u201d 1 \u201cEven 1 from 1 the 1 scientific 1 standpoint 1 the 1 chances 1 against 1 our 1 being 1 struck 1 are 1 enormous. 1 The 1 steel 1 knives, 1 the 1 only 1 articles 1 which 1 might 1 attract 1 the 1 current, 1 are 1 in 1 the 1 other 1 had 1 to 1 stop 1 their 1 tennis 1 and 1 to 1 entertain 1 her 1 for 1 a 1 solid 1 hour. 1 Cecil 1 and 1 Lucy 1 turned 1 up 1 at 1 four 1 o\u2019clock, 1 and 1 these, 1 with 1 little 1 Minnie 1 Beebe, 1 made 1 a 1 somewhat 1 lugubrious 1 sextette 1 upon 1 the 1 upper 1 lawn 1 for 1 tea. 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 never 1 forgive 1 myself,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 kept 1 on 1 rising 1 from 1 her 1 seat, 1 and 1 had 1 to 1 be 1 begged 1 by 1 the 1 united 1 company 1 to 1 remain. 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 upset 1 everything. 1 Bursting 1 in 1 on 1 young 1 people! 1 But 1 I 1 insist 1 on 1 paying 1 for 1 my 1 cab 1 up. 1 Grant 1 that, 1 at 1 any 1 rate.\u201d 1 \u201cOur 1 visitors 1 never 1 do 1 such 1 dreadful 1 things,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 while 1 her 1 brother, 1 in 1 whose 1 memory 1 the 1 boiled 1 egg 1 had 1 already 1 grown 1 unsubstantial, 1 exclaimed 1 in 1 irritable 1 tones: 1 \u201cJust 1 what 1 I\u2019ve 1 been 1 trying 1 to 1 convince 1 Cousin 1 Charlotte 1 of, 1 Lucy, 1 for 1 the 1 last 1 half 1 hour.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 do 1 not 1 feel 1 myself 1 an 1 ordinary 1 visitor,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 and 1 looked 1 at 1 her 1 frayed 1 glove. 1 \u201cAll 1 right, 1 if 1 you\u2019d 1 really 1 rather. 1 Five 1 shillings, 1 and 1 I 1 gave 1 a 1 bob 1 to 1 the 1 driver.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 looked 1 in 1 her 1 purse. 1 Only 1 sovereigns 1 and 1 pennies. 1 Could 1 any 1 one 1 give 1 her 1 change? 1 Freddy 1 had 1 half 1 a 1 quid 1 and 1 his 1 friend 1 had 1 four 1 half-crowns. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 accepted 1 their 1 moneys 1 and 1 then 1 said: 1 \u201cBut 1 who 1 am 1 I 1 to 1 give 1 the 1 sovereign 1 to?\u201d 1 \u201cLet\u2019s 1 leave 1 it 1 all 1 till 1 mother 1 comes 1 back,\u201d 1 suggested 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cNo, 1 dear; 1 your 1 mother 1 may 1 take 1 quite 1 a 1 long 1 drive 1 now 1 that 1 she 1 is 1 not 1 hampered 1 with 1 me. 1 We 1 all 1 have 1 our 1 little 1 foibles, 1 and 1 mine 1 is 1 the 1 prompt 1 settling 1 of 1 accounts.\u201d 1 Here 1 Freddy\u2019s 1 friend, 1 Mr. 1 Floyd, 1 made 1 the 1 one 1 remark 1 of 1 his 1 that 1 need 1 be 1 quoted: 1 he 1 offered 1 to 1 toss 1 Freddy 1 for 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 quid. 1 A 1 solution 1 seemed 1 in 1 sight, 1 and 1 even 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 had 1 been 1 ostentatiously 1 drinking 1 his 1 tea 1 at 1 the 1 view, 1 felt 1 the 1 eternal 1 attraction 1 of 1 Chance, 1 and 1 turned 1 round. 1 But 1 this 1 did 1 not 1 do, 1 either. 1 \u201cPlease--please--I 1 know 1 I 1 am 1 a 1 sad 1 spoil-sport, 1 but 1 it 1 would 1 make 1 me 1 wretched. 1 I 1 should 1 practically 1 be 1 robbing 1 the 1 one 1 who 1 lost.\u201d 1 \u201cFreddy 1 owes 1 me 1 fifteen 1 shillings,\u201d 1 interposed 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cSo 1 it 1 will 1 work 1 out 1 right 1 if 1 you 1 give 1 the 1 pound 1 to 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cFifteen 1 shillings,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 dubiously. 1 \u201cHow 1 is 1 that, 1 Mr. 1 Vyse?\u201d 1 \u201cBecause, 1 don\u2019t 1 you 1 see, 1 Freddy 1 paid 1 your 1 cab. 1 Give 1 me 1 the 1 pound, 1 and 1 we 1 shall 1 avoid 1 this 1 deplorable 1 gambling.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 was 1 poor 1 at 1 figures, 1 became 1 bewildered 1 and 1 rendered 1 up 1 the 1 sovereign, 1 amidst 1 the 1 suppressed 1 gurgles 1 of 1 the 1 other 1 youths. 1 For 1 a 1 moment 1 Cecil 1 was 1 happy. 1 He 1 was 1 playing 1 at 1 nonsense 1 among 1 his 1 peers. 1 Then 1 he 1 glanced 1 at 1 Lucy, 1 in 1 whose 1 face 1 petty 1 anxieties 1 had 1 marred 1 the 1 smiles. 1 In 1 January 1 he 1 would 1 rescue 1 his 1 Leonardo 1 from 1 this 1 stupefying 1 twaddle. 1 \u201cBut 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 that!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Minnie 1 Beebe 1 who 1 had 1 narrowly 1 watched 1 the 1 iniquitous 1 transaction. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 why 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 is 1 to 1 have 1 the 1 quid.\u201d 1 \u201cBecause 1 of 1 the 1 fifteen 1 shillings 1 and 1 the 1 five,\u201d 1 they 1 said 1 solemnly. 1 \u201cFifteen 1 shillings 1 and 1 five 1 shillings 1 make 1 one 1 pound, 1 you 1 see.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 see--\u201d 1 They 1 tried 1 to 1 stifle 1 her 1 with 1 cake. 1 \u201cNo, 1 thank 1 you. 1 I\u2019m 1 done. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 why--Freddy, 1 don\u2019t 1 poke 1 me. 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 your 1 brother\u2019s 1 hurting 1 me. 1 Ow! 1 What 1 about 1 Mr. 1 Floyd\u2019s 1 ten 1 shillings? 1 Ow! 1 No, 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 and 1 I 1 never 1 shall 1 see 1 why 1 Miss 1 What\u2019s-her-name 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 pay 1 that 1 bob 1 for 1 the 1 driver.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 had 1 forgotten 1 the 1 driver,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 reddening. 1 \u201cThank 1 you, 1 dear, 1 for 1 reminding 1 me. 1 A 1 shilling 1 was 1 it? 1 Can 1 any 1 one 1 give 1 me 1 change 1 for 1 half 1 a 1 crown?\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019ll 1 get 1 it,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 young 1 hostess, 1 rising 1 with 1 decision. 1 \u201cCecil, 1 give 1 me 1 that 1 sovereign. 1 No, 1 give 1 me 1 up 1 that 1 sovereign. 1 I\u2019ll 1 get 1 Euphemia 1 to 1 change 1 it, 1 and 1 we\u2019ll 1 start 1 the 1 whole 1 thing 1 again 1 from 1 the 1 beginning.\u201d 1 \u201cLucy--Lucy--what 1 a 1 nuisance 1 I 1 am!\u201d 1 protested 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 and 1 followed 1 her 1 across 1 the 1 lawn. 1 Lucy 1 tripped 1 ahead, 1 simulating 1 hilarity. 1 When 1 they 1 were 1 out 1 of 1 earshot 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 stopped 1 her 1 wails 1 and 1 said 1 quite 1 briskly: 1 \u201cHave 1 you 1 told 1 him 1 about 1 him 1 yet?\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 haven\u2019t,\u201d 1 replied 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 then 1 could 1 have 1 bitten 1 her 1 tongue 1 for 1 understanding 1 so 1 quickly 1 what 1 her 1 cousin 1 meant. 1 \u201cLet 1 me 1 see--a 1 sovereign\u2019s 1 worth 1 of 1 silver.\u201d 1 She 1 escaped 1 into 1 the 1 kitchen. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 sudden 1 transitions 1 were 1 too 1 uncanny. 1 It 1 sometimes 1 seemed 1 as 1 if 1 she 1 planned 1 every 1 word 1 she 1 spoke 1 or 1 caused 1 to 1 be 1 spoken; 1 as 1 if 1 all 1 this 1 worry 1 about 1 cabs 1 and 1 change 1 had 1 been 1 a 1 ruse 1 to 1 surprise 1 the 1 soul. 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 haven\u2019t 1 told 1 Cecil 1 or 1 any 1 one,\u201d 1 she 1 remarked, 1 when 1 she 1 returned. 1 \u201cI 1 promised 1 you 1 I 1 shouldn\u2019t. 1 Here 1 is 1 your 1 money--all 1 shillings, 1 except 1 two 1 half-crowns. 1 Would 1 you 1 count 1 it? 1 You 1 can 1 settle 1 your 1 debt 1 nicely 1 now.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 in 1 the 1 drawing-room, 1 gazing 1 at 1 the 1 photograph 1 of 1 St. 1 John 1 ascending, 1 which 1 had 1 been 1 framed. 1 \u201cHow 1 dreadful!\u201d 1 she 1 murmured, 1 \u201chow 1 more 1 than 1 dreadful, 1 if 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 should 1 come 1 to 1 hear 1 of 1 it 1 from 1 some 1 other 1 source.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 no, 1 Charlotte,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 girl, 1 entering 1 the 1 battle. 1 \u201cGeorge 1 Emerson 1 is 1 all 1 right, 1 and 1 what 1 other 1 source 1 is 1 there?\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 considered. 1 \u201cFor 1 instance, 1 the 1 driver. 1 I 1 saw 1 him 1 looking 1 through 1 the 1 bushes 1 at 1 you, 1 remember 1 he 1 had 1 a 1 violet 1 between 1 his 1 teeth.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 shuddered 1 a 1 little. 1 \u201cWe 1 shall 1 get 1 the 1 silly 1 affair 1 on 1 our 1 nerves 1 if 1 we 1 aren\u2019t 1 careful. 1 How 1 could 1 a 1 Florentine 1 cab-driver 1 ever 1 get 1 hold 1 of 1 Cecil?\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 must 1 think 1 of 1 every 1 possibility.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 it\u2019s 1 all 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cOr 1 perhaps 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 knows. 1 In 1 fact, 1 he 1 is 1 certain 1 to 1 know.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 care 1 if 1 he 1 does. 1 I 1 was 1 grateful 1 to 1 you 1 for 1 your 1 letter, 1 but 1 even 1 if 1 the 1 news 1 does 1 get 1 round, 1 I 1 think 1 I 1 can 1 trust 1 Cecil 1 to 1 laugh 1 at 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cTo 1 contradict 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 to 1 laugh 1 at 1 it.\u201d 1 But 1 she 1 knew 1 in 1 her 1 heart 1 that 1 she 1 could 1 not 1 trust 1 him, 1 for 1 he 1 desired 1 her 1 untouched. 1 \u201cVery 1 well, 1 dear, 1 you 1 know 1 best. 1 Perhaps 1 gentlemen 1 are 1 different 1 to 1 what 1 they 1 were 1 when 1 I 1 was 1 young. 1 Ladies 1 are 1 certainly 1 different.\u201d 1 \u201cNow, 1 Charlotte!\u201d 1 She 1 struck 1 at 1 her 1 playfully. 1 \u201cYou 1 kind, 1 anxious 1 thing. 1 What 1 WOULD 1 you 1 have 1 me 1 do? 1 First 1 you 1 say 1 \u2018Don\u2019t 1 tell\u2019; 1 and 1 then 1 you 1 say, 1 \u2018Tell\u2019. 1 Which 1 is 1 it 1 to 1 be? 1 Quick!\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 sighed 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 no 1 match 1 for 1 you 1 in 1 conversation, 1 dearest. 1 I 1 blush 1 when 1 I 1 think 1 how 1 I 1 interfered 1 at 1 Florence, 1 and 1 you 1 so 1 well 1 able 1 to 1 look 1 after 1 yourself, 1 and 1 so 1 much 1 cleverer 1 in 1 all 1 ways 1 than 1 I 1 am. 1 You 1 will 1 never 1 forgive 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cShall 1 we 1 go 1 out, 1 then. 1 They 1 will 1 smash 1 all 1 the 1 china 1 if 1 we 1 don\u2019t.\u201d 1 For 1 the 1 air 1 rang 1 with 1 the 1 shrieks 1 of 1 Minnie, 1 who 1 was 1 being 1 scalped 1 with 1 a 1 teaspoon. 1 \u201cDear, 1 one 1 moment--we 1 may 1 not 1 have 1 this 1 chance 1 for 1 a 1 chat 1 again. 1 Have 1 you 1 seen 1 the 1 young 1 one 1 yet?\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 I 1 have.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 happened?\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 met 1 at 1 the 1 Rectory.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 line 1 is 1 he 1 taking 1 up?\u201d 1 \u201cNo 1 line. 1 He 1 talked 1 about 1 Italy, 1 like 1 any 1 other 1 person. 1 It 1 is 1 really 1 all 1 right. 1 What 1 advantage 1 would 1 he 1 get 1 from 1 being 1 a 1 cad, 1 to 1 put 1 it 1 bluntly? 1 I 1 do 1 wish 1 I 1 could 1 make 1 you 1 see 1 it 1 my 1 way. 1 He 1 really 1 won\u2019t 1 be 1 any 1 nuisance, 1 Charlotte.\u201d 1 \u201cOnce 1 a 1 cad, 1 always 1 a 1 cad. 1 That 1 is 1 my 1 poor 1 opinion.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 paused. 1 \u201cCecil 1 said 1 one 1 day--and 1 I 1 thought 1 it 1 so 1 profound--that 1 there 1 are 1 two 1 kinds 1 of 1 cads--the 1 conscious 1 and 1 the 1 subconscious.\u201d 1 She 1 paused 1 again, 1 to 1 be 1 sure 1 of 1 doing 1 justice 1 to 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 profundity. 1 Through 1 the 1 window 1 she 1 saw 1 Cecil 1 himself, 1 turning 1 over 1 the 1 pages 1 of 1 a 1 novel. 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 new 1 one 1 from 1 Smith\u2019s 1 library. 1 Her 1 mother 1 must 1 have 1 returned 1 from 1 the 1 station. 1 \u201cOnce 1 a 1 cad, 1 always 1 a 1 cad,\u201d 1 droned 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cWhat 1 I 1 mean 1 by 1 subconscious 1 is 1 that 1 Emerson 1 lost 1 his 1 head. 1 I 1 fell 1 into 1 all 1 those 1 violets, 1 and 1 he 1 was 1 silly 1 and 1 surprised. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 think 1 we 1 ought 1 to 1 blame 1 him 1 very 1 much. 1 It 1 makes 1 such 1 a 1 difference 1 when 1 you 1 see 1 a 1 person 1 with 1 beautiful 1 things 1 behind 1 him 1 unexpectedly. 1 It 1 really 1 does; 1 it 1 makes 1 an 1 enormous 1 difference, 1 and 1 he 1 lost 1 his 1 head: 1 he 1 doesn\u2019t 1 admire 1 me, 1 or 1 any 1 of 1 that 1 nonsense, 1 one 1 straw. 1 Freddy 1 rather 1 likes 1 him, 1 and 1 has 1 asked 1 him 1 up 1 here 1 on 1 Sunday, 1 so 1 you 1 can 1 judge 1 for 1 yourself. 1 He 1 has 1 improved; 1 he 1 doesn\u2019t 1 always 1 look 1 as 1 if 1 he\u2019s 1 going 1 to 1 burst 1 into 1 tears. 1 He 1 is 1 a 1 clerk 1 in 1 the 1 General 1 Manager\u2019s 1 office 1 at 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 big 1 railways--not 1 a 1 porter! 1 and 1 runs 1 down 1 to 1 his 1 father 1 for 1 week-ends. 1 Papa 1 was 1 to 1 do 1 with 1 journalism, 1 but 1 is 1 rheumatic 1 and 1 has 1 retired. 1 There! 1 Now 1 for 1 the 1 garden.\u201d 1 She 1 took 1 hold 1 of 1 her 1 guest 1 by 1 the 1 arm. 1 \u201cSuppose 1 we 1 don\u2019t 1 talk 1 about 1 this 1 silly 1 Italian 1 business 1 any 1 more. 1 We 1 want 1 you 1 to 1 have 1 a 1 nice 1 restful 1 visit 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner, 1 with 1 no 1 worriting.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 thought 1 this 1 rather 1 a 1 good 1 speech. 1 The 1 reader 1 may 1 have 1 detected 1 an 1 unfortunate 1 slip 1 in 1 it. 1 Whether 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 detected 1 the 1 slip 1 one 1 cannot 1 say, 1 for 1 it 1 is 1 impossible 1 to 1 penetrate 1 into 1 the 1 minds 1 of 1 elderly 1 people. 1 She 1 might 1 have 1 spoken 1 further, 1 but 1 they 1 were 1 interrupted 1 by 1 the 1 entrance 1 of 1 her 1 hostess. 1 Explanations 1 took 1 place, 1 and 1 in 1 the 1 midst 1 of 1 them 1 Lucy 1 escaped, 1 the 1 images 1 throbbing 1 a 1 little 1 more 1 vividly 1 in 1 her 1 brain. 1 Chapter 1 XV: 1 The 1 Disaster 1 Within 1 The 1 Sunday 1 after 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 arrival 1 was 1 a 1 glorious 1 day, 1 like 1 most 1 of 1 the 1 days 1 of 1 that 1 year. 1 In 1 the 1 Weald, 1 autumn 1 approached, 1 breaking 1 up 1 the 1 green 1 monotony 1 of 1 summer, 1 touching 1 the 1 parks 1 with 1 the 1 grey 1 bloom 1 of 1 mist, 1 the 1 beech-trees 1 with 1 russet, 1 the 1 oak-trees 1 with 1 gold. 1 Up 1 on 1 the 1 heights, 1 battalions 1 of 1 black 1 pines 1 witnessed 1 the 1 change, 1 themselves 1 unchangeable. 1 Either 1 country 1 was 1 spanned 1 by 1 a 1 cloudless 1 sky, 1 and 1 in 1 either 1 arose 1 the 1 tinkle 1 of 1 church 1 bells. 1 The 1 garden 1 of 1 Windy 1 Corners 1 was 1 deserted 1 except 1 for 1 a 1 red 1 book, 1 which 1 lay 1 sunning 1 itself 1 upon 1 the 1 gravel 1 path. 1 From 1 the 1 house 1 came 1 incoherent 1 sounds, 1 as 1 of 1 females 1 preparing 1 for 1 worship. 1 \u201cThe 1 men 1 say 1 they 1 won\u2019t 1 go\u201d--\u201cWell, 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 blame 1 them\u201d--Minnie 1 says, 1 \u201cneed 1 she 1 go?\u201d--\u201cTell 1 her, 1 no 1 nonsense\u201d--\u201cAnne! 1 Mary! 1 Hook 1 me 1 behind!\u201d--\u201cDearest 1 Lucia, 1 may 1 I 1 trespass 1 upon 1 you 1 for 1 a 1 pin?\u201d 1 For 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 announced 1 that 1 she 1 at 1 all 1 events 1 was 1 one 1 for 1 church. 1 The 1 sun 1 rose 1 higher 1 on 1 its 1 journey, 1 guided, 1 not 1 by 1 Phaethon, 1 but 1 by 1 Apollo, 1 competent, 1 unswerving, 1 divine. 1 Its 1 rays 1 fell 1 on 1 the 1 ladies 1 whenever 1 they 1 advanced 1 towards 1 the 1 bedroom 1 windows; 1 on 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 down 1 at 1 Summer 1 Street 1 as 1 he 1 smiled 1 over 1", "0", "40190"], "mapper-6-count-output": ["dear 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 you 1 will 1 catch 1 a 1 chill! 1 And 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 here 1 besides. 1 Who 1 would 1 suppose 1 this 1 is 1 Italy? 1 There 1 is 1 my 1 sister 1 actually 1 nursing 1 the 1 hot-water 1 can; 1 no 1 comforts 1 or 1 proper 1 provisions.\u201d 1 She 1 sidled 1 towards 1 them 1 and 1 sat 1 down, 1 self-conscious 1 as 1 she 1 always 1 was 1 on 1 entering 1 a 1 room 1 which 1 contained 1 one 1 man, 1 or 1 a 1 man 1 and 1 one 1 woman. 1 \u201cI 1 could 1 hear 1 your 1 beautiful 1 playing, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 though 1 I 1 was 1 in 1 my 1 room 1 with 1 the 1 door 1 shut. 1 Doors 1 shut; 1 indeed, 1 most 1 necessary. 1 No 1 one 1 has 1 the 1 least 1 idea 1 of 1 privacy 1 in 1 this 1 country. 1 And 1 one 1 person 1 catches 1 it 1 from 1 another.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 answered 1 suitably. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 not 1 able 1 to 1 tell 1 the 1 ladies 1 of 1 his 1 adventure 1 at 1 Modena, 1 where 1 the 1 chambermaid 1 burst 1 in 1 upon 1 him 1 in 1 his 1 bath, 1 exclaiming 1 cheerfully, 1 \u201cFa 1 niente, 1 sono 1 vecchia.\u201d 1 He 1 contented 1 himself 1 with 1 saying: 1 \u201cI 1 quite 1 agree 1 with 1 you, 1 Miss 1 Alan. 1 The 1 Italians 1 are 1 a 1 most 1 unpleasant 1 people. 1 They 1 pry 1 everywhere, 1 they 1 see 1 everything, 1 and 1 they 1 know 1 what 1 we 1 want 1 before 1 we 1 know 1 it 1 ourselves. 1 We 1 are 1 at 1 their 1 mercy. 1 They 1 read 1 our 1 thoughts, 1 they 1 foretell 1 our 1 desires. 1 From 1 the 1 cab-driver 1 down 1 to--to 1 Giotto, 1 they 1 turn 1 us 1 inside 1 out, 1 and 1 I 1 resent 1 it. 1 Yet 1 in 1 their 1 heart 1 of 1 hearts 1 they 1 are--how 1 superficial! 1 They 1 have 1 no 1 conception 1 of 1 the 1 intellectual 1 life. 1 How 1 right 1 is 1 Signora 1 Bertolini, 1 who 1 exclaimed 1 to 1 me 1 the 1 other 1 day: 1 \u2018Ho, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 if 1 you 1 knew 1 what 1 I 1 suffer 1 over 1 the 1 children\u2019s 1 edjucaishion. 1 HI 1 won\u2019t 1 \u2018ave 1 my 1 little 1 Victorier 1 taught 1 by 1 a 1 hignorant 1 Italian 1 what 1 can\u2019t 1 explain 1 nothink!\u2019\u201d 1 Miss 1 Alan 1 did 1 not 1 follow, 1 but 1 gathered 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 being 1 mocked 1 in 1 an 1 agreeable 1 way. 1 Her 1 sister 1 was 1 a 1 little 1 disappointed 1 in 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 having 1 expected 1 better 1 things 1 from 1 a 1 clergyman 1 whose 1 head 1 was 1 bald 1 and 1 who 1 wore 1 a 1 pair 1 of 1 russet 1 whiskers. 1 Indeed, 1 who 1 would 1 have 1 supposed 1 that 1 tolerance, 1 sympathy, 1 and 1 a 1 sense 1 of 1 humour 1 would 1 inhabit 1 that 1 militant 1 form? 1 In 1 the 1 midst 1 of 1 her 1 satisfaction 1 she 1 continued 1 to 1 sidle, 1 and 1 at 1 last 1 the 1 cause 1 was 1 disclosed. 1 From 1 the 1 chair 1 beneath 1 her 1 she 1 extracted 1 a 1 gun-metal 1 cigarette-case, 1 on 1 which 1 were 1 powdered 1 in 1 turquoise 1 the 1 initials 1 \u201cE. 1 L.\u201d 1 \u201cThat 1 belongs 1 to 1 Lavish.\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 clergyman. 1 \u201cA 1 good 1 fellow, 1 Lavish, 1 but 1 I 1 wish 1 she\u2019d 1 start 1 a 1 pipe.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Alan, 1 divided 1 between 1 awe 1 and 1 mirth. 1 \u201cIndeed, 1 though 1 it 1 is 1 dreadful 1 for 1 her 1 to 1 smoke, 1 it 1 is 1 not 1 quite 1 as 1 dreadful 1 as 1 you 1 suppose. 1 She 1 took 1 to 1 it, 1 practically 1 in 1 despair, 1 after 1 her 1 life\u2019s 1 work 1 was 1 carried 1 away 1 in 1 a 1 landslip. 1 Surely 1 that 1 makes 1 it 1 more 1 excusable.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 was 1 that?\u201d 1 asked 1 Lucy. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 sat 1 back 1 complacently, 1 and 1 Miss 1 Alan 1 began 1 as 1 follows: 1 \u201cIt 1 was 1 a 1 novel--and 1 I 1 am 1 afraid, 1 from 1 what 1 I 1 can 1 gather, 1 not 1 a 1 very 1 nice 1 novel. 1 It 1 is 1 so 1 sad 1 when 1 people 1 who 1 have 1 abilities 1 misuse 1 them, 1 and 1 I 1 must 1 say 1 they 1 nearly 1 always 1 do. 1 Anyhow, 1 she 1 left 1 it 1 almost 1 finished 1 in 1 the 1 Grotto 1 of 1 the 1 Calvary 1 at 1 the 1 Capuccini 1 Hotel 1 at 1 Amalfi 1 while 1 she 1 went 1 for 1 a 1 little 1 ink. 1 She 1 said: 1 \u2018Can 1 I 1 have 1 a 1 little 1 ink, 1 please?\u2019 1 But 1 you 1 know 1 what 1 Italians 1 are, 1 and 1 meanwhile 1 the 1 Grotto 1 fell 1 roaring 1 on 1 to 1 the 1 beach, 1 and 1 the 1 saddest 1 thing 1 of 1 all 1 is 1 that 1 she 1 cannot 1 remember 1 what 1 she 1 has 1 written. 1 The 1 poor 1 thing 1 was 1 very 1 ill 1 after 1 it, 1 and 1 so 1 got 1 tempted 1 into 1 cigarettes. 1 It 1 is 1 a 1 great 1 secret, 1 but 1 I 1 am 1 glad 1 to 1 say 1 that 1 she 1 is 1 writing 1 another 1 novel. 1 She 1 told 1 Teresa 1 and 1 Miss 1 Pole 1 the 1 other 1 day 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 got 1 up 1 all 1 the 1 local 1 colour--this 1 novel 1 is 1 to 1 be 1 about 1 modern 1 Italy; 1 the 1 other 1 was 1 historical--but 1 that 1 she 1 could 1 not 1 start 1 till 1 she 1 had 1 an 1 idea. 1 First 1 she 1 tried 1 Perugia 1 for 1 an 1 inspiration, 1 then 1 she 1 came 1 here--this 1 must 1 on 1 no 1 account 1 get 1 round. 1 And 1 so 1 cheerful 1 through 1 it 1 all! 1 I 1 cannot 1 help 1 thinking 1 that 1 there 1 is 1 something 1 to 1 admire 1 in 1 everyone, 1 even 1 if 1 you 1 do 1 not 1 approve 1 of 1 them.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Alan 1 was 1 always 1 thus 1 being 1 charitable 1 against 1 her 1 better 1 judgement. 1 A 1 delicate 1 pathos 1 perfumed 1 her 1 disconnected 1 remarks, 1 giving 1 them 1 unexpected 1 beauty, 1 just 1 as 1 in 1 the 1 decaying 1 autumn 1 woods 1 there 1 sometimes 1 rise 1 odours 1 reminiscent 1 of 1 spring. 1 She 1 felt 1 she 1 had 1 made 1 almost 1 too 1 many 1 allowances, 1 and 1 apologized 1 hurriedly 1 for 1 her 1 toleration. 1 \u201cAll 1 the 1 same, 1 she 1 is 1 a 1 little 1 too--I 1 hardly 1 like 1 to 1 say 1 unwomanly, 1 but 1 she 1 behaved 1 most 1 strangely 1 when 1 the 1 Emersons 1 arrived.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 smiled 1 as 1 Miss 1 Alan 1 plunged 1 into 1 an 1 anecdote 1 which 1 he 1 knew 1 she 1 would 1 be 1 unable 1 to 1 finish 1 in 1 the 1 presence 1 of 1 a 1 gentleman. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 know, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 if 1 you 1 have 1 noticed 1 that 1 Miss 1 Pole, 1 the 1 lady 1 who 1 has 1 so 1 much 1 yellow 1 hair, 1 takes 1 lemonade. 1 That 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 who 1 puts 1 things 1 very 1 strangely--\u201d 1 Her 1 jaw 1 dropped. 1 She 1 was 1 silent. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 whose 1 social 1 resources 1 were 1 endless, 1 went 1 out 1 to 1 order 1 some 1 tea, 1 and 1 she 1 continued 1 to 1 Lucy 1 in 1 a 1 hasty 1 whisper: 1 \u201cStomach. 1 He 1 warned 1 Miss 1 Pole 1 of 1 her 1 stomach-acidity, 1 he 1 called 1 it--and 1 he 1 may 1 have 1 meant 1 to 1 be 1 kind. 1 I 1 must 1 say 1 I 1 forgot 1 myself 1 and 1 laughed; 1 it 1 was 1 so 1 sudden. 1 As 1 Teresa 1 truly 1 said, 1 it 1 was 1 no 1 laughing 1 matter. 1 But 1 the 1 point 1 is 1 that 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 was 1 positively 1 ATTRACTED 1 by 1 his 1 mentioning 1 S., 1 and 1 said 1 she 1 liked 1 plain 1 speaking, 1 and 1 meeting 1 different 1 grades 1 of 1 thought. 1 She 1 thought 1 they 1 were 1 commercial 1 travellers--\u2018drummers\u2019 1 was 1 the 1 word 1 she 1 used--and 1 all 1 through 1 dinner 1 she 1 tried 1 to 1 prove 1 that 1 England, 1 our 1 great 1 and 1 beloved 1 country, 1 rests 1 on 1 nothing 1 but 1 commerce. 1 Teresa 1 was 1 very 1 much 1 annoyed, 1 and 1 left 1 the 1 table 1 before 1 the 1 cheese, 1 saying 1 as 1 she 1 did 1 so: 1 \u2018There, 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 is 1 one 1 who 1 can 1 confute 1 you 1 better 1 than 1 I,\u2019 1 and 1 pointed 1 to 1 that 1 beautiful 1 picture 1 of 1 Lord 1 Tennyson. 1 Then 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 said: 1 \u2018Tut! 1 The 1 early 1 Victorians.\u2019 1 Just 1 imagine! 1 \u2018Tut! 1 The 1 early 1 Victorians.\u2019 1 My 1 sister 1 had 1 gone, 1 and 1 I 1 felt 1 bound 1 to 1 speak. 1 I 1 said: 1 \u2018Miss 1 Lavish, 1 I 1 am 1 an 1 early 1 Victorian; 1 at 1 least, 1 that 1 is 1 to 1 say, 1 I 1 will 1 hear 1 no 1 breath 1 of 1 censure 1 against 1 our 1 dear 1 Queen.\u2019 1 It 1 was 1 horrible 1 speaking. 1 I 1 reminded 1 her 1 how 1 the 1 Queen 1 had 1 been 1 to 1 Ireland 1 when 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 want 1 to 1 go, 1 and 1 I 1 must 1 say 1 she 1 was 1 dumbfounded, 1 and 1 made 1 no 1 reply. 1 But, 1 unluckily, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 overheard 1 this 1 part, 1 and 1 called 1 in 1 his 1 deep 1 voice: 1 \u2018Quite 1 so, 1 quite 1 so! 1 I 1 honour 1 the 1 woman 1 for 1 her 1 Irish 1 visit.\u2019 1 The 1 woman! 1 I 1 tell 1 things 1 so 1 badly; 1 but 1 you 1 see 1 what 1 a 1 tangle 1 we 1 were 1 in 1 by 1 this 1 time, 1 all 1 on 1 account 1 of 1 S. 1 having 1 been 1 mentioned 1 in 1 the 1 first 1 place. 1 But 1 that 1 was 1 not 1 all. 1 After 1 dinner 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 actually 1 came 1 up 1 and 1 said: 1 \u2018Miss 1 Alan, 1 I 1 am 1 going 1 into 1 the 1 smoking-room 1 to 1 talk 1 to 1 those 1 two 1 nice 1 men. 1 Come, 1 too.\u2019 1 Needless 1 to 1 say, 1 I 1 refused 1 such 1 an 1 unsuitable 1 invitation, 1 and 1 she 1 had 1 the 1 impertinence 1 to 1 tell 1 me 1 that 1 it 1 would 1 broaden 1 my 1 ideas, 1 and 1 said 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 four 1 brothers, 1 all 1 University 1 men, 1 except 1 one 1 who 1 was 1 in 1 the 1 army, 1 who 1 always 1 made 1 a 1 point 1 of 1 talking 1 to 1 commercial 1 travellers.\u201d 1 \u201cLet 1 me 1 finish 1 the 1 story,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 who 1 had 1 returned. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Lavish 1 tried 1 Miss 1 Pole, 1 myself, 1 everyone, 1 and 1 finally 1 said: 1 \u2018I 1 shall 1 go 1 alone.\u2019 1 She 1 went. 1 At 1 the 1 end 1 of 1 five 1 minutes 1 she 1 returned 1 unobtrusively 1 with 1 a 1 green 1 baize 1 board, 1 and 1 began 1 playing 1 patience.\u201d 1 \u201cWhatever 1 happened?\u201d 1 cried 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cNo 1 one 1 knows. 1 No 1 one 1 will 1 ever 1 know. 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 will 1 never 1 dare 1 to 1 tell, 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 does 1 not 1 think 1 it 1 worth 1 telling.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe--old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 is 1 he 1 nice 1 or 1 not 1 nice? 1 I 1 do 1 so 1 want 1 to 1 know.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 laughed 1 and 1 suggested 1 that 1 she 1 should 1 settle 1 the 1 question 1 for 1 herself. 1 \u201cNo; 1 but 1 it 1 is 1 so 1 difficult. 1 Sometimes 1 he 1 is 1 so 1 silly, 1 and 1 then 1 I 1 do 1 not 1 mind 1 him. 1 Miss 1 Alan, 1 what 1 do 1 you 1 think? 1 Is 1 he 1 nice?\u201d 1 The 1 little 1 old 1 lady 1 shook 1 her 1 head, 1 and 1 sighed 1 disapprovingly. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 whom 1 the 1 conversation 1 amused, 1 stirred 1 her 1 up 1 by 1 saying: 1 \u201cI 1 consider 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 bound 1 to 1 class 1 him 1 as 1 nice, 1 Miss 1 Alan, 1 after 1 that 1 business 1 of 1 the 1 violets.\u201d 1 \u201cViolets? 1 Oh, 1 dear! 1 Who 1 told 1 you 1 about 1 the 1 violets? 1 How 1 do 1 things 1 get 1 round? 1 A 1 pension 1 is 1 a 1 bad 1 place 1 for 1 gossips. 1 No, 1 I 1 cannot 1 forget 1 how 1 they 1 behaved 1 at 1 Mr. 1 Eager\u2019s 1 lecture 1 at 1 Santa 1 Croce. 1 Oh, 1 poor 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch! 1 It 1 really 1 was 1 too 1 bad. 1 No, 1 I 1 have 1 quite 1 changed. 1 I 1 do 1 NOT 1 like 1 the 1 Emersons. 1 They 1 are 1 not 1 nice.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 smiled 1 nonchalantly. 1 He 1 had 1 made 1 a 1 gentle 1 effort 1 to 1 introduce 1 the 1 Emersons 1 into 1 Bertolini 1 society, 1 and 1 the 1 effort 1 had 1 failed. 1 He 1 was 1 almost 1 the 1 only 1 person 1 who 1 remained 1 friendly 1 to 1 them. 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 who 1 represented 1 intellect, 1 was 1 avowedly 1 hostile, 1 and 1 now 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans, 1 who 1 stood 1 for 1 good 1 breeding, 1 were 1 following 1 her. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 smarting 1 under 1 an 1 obligation, 1 would 1 scarcely 1 be 1 civil. 1 The 1 case 1 of 1 Lucy 1 was 1 different. 1 She 1 had 1 given 1 him 1 a 1 hazy 1 account 1 of 1 her 1 adventures 1 in 1 Santa 1 Croce, 1 and 1 he 1 gathered 1 that 1 the 1 two 1 men 1 had 1 made 1 a 1 curious 1 and 1 possibly 1 concerted 1 attempt 1 to 1 annex 1 her, 1 to 1 show 1 her 1 the 1 world 1 from 1 their 1 own 1 strange 1 standpoint, 1 to 1 interest 1 her 1 in 1 their 1 private 1 sorrows 1 and 1 joys. 1 This 1 was 1 impertinent; 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 wish 1 their 1 cause 1 to 1 be 1 championed 1 by 1 a 1 young 1 girl: 1 he 1 would 1 rather 1 it 1 should 1 fail. 1 After 1 all, 1 he 1 knew 1 nothing 1 about 1 them, 1 and 1 pension 1 joys, 1 pension 1 sorrows, 1 are 1 flimsy 1 things; 1 whereas 1 Lucy 1 would 1 be 1 his 1 parishioner. 1 Lucy, 1 with 1 one 1 eye 1 upon 1 the 1 weather, 1 finally 1 said 1 that 1 she 1 thought 1 the 1 Emersons 1 were 1 nice; 1 not 1 that 1 she 1 saw 1 anything 1 of 1 them 1 now. 1 Even 1 their 1 seats 1 at 1 dinner 1 had 1 been 1 moved. 1 \u201cBut 1 aren\u2019t 1 they 1 always 1 waylaying 1 you 1 to 1 go 1 out 1 with 1 them, 1 dear?\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 little 1 lady 1 inquisitively. 1 \u201cOnly 1 once. 1 Charlotte 1 didn\u2019t 1 like 1 it, 1 and 1 said 1 something--quite 1 politely, 1 of 1 course.\u201d 1 \u201cMost 1 right 1 of 1 her. 1 They 1 don\u2019t 1 understand 1 our 1 ways. 1 They 1 must 1 find 1 their 1 level.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 rather 1 felt 1 that 1 they 1 had 1 gone 1 under. 1 They 1 had 1 given 1 up 1 their 1 attempt--if 1 it 1 was 1 one--to 1 conquer 1 society, 1 and 1 now 1 the 1 father 1 was 1 almost 1 as 1 silent 1 as 1 the 1 son. 1 He 1 wondered 1 whether 1 he 1 would 1 not 1 plan 1 a 1 pleasant 1 day 1 for 1 these 1 folk 1 before 1 they 1 left--some 1 expedition, 1 perhaps, 1 with 1 Lucy 1 well 1 chaperoned 1 to 1 be 1 nice 1 to 1 them. 1 It 1 was 1 one 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 chief 1 pleasures 1 to 1 provide 1 people 1 with 1 happy 1 memories. 1 Evening 1 approached 1 while 1 they 1 chatted; 1 the 1 air 1 became 1 brighter; 1 the 1 colours 1 on 1 the 1 trees 1 and 1 hills 1 were 1 purified, 1 and 1 the 1 Arno 1 lost 1 its 1 muddy 1 solidity 1 and 1 began 1 to 1 twinkle. 1 There 1 were 1 a 1 few 1 streaks 1 of 1 bluish-green 1 among 1 the 1 clouds, 1 she 1 had 1 seemed 1 a 1 typical 1 tourist--shrill, 1 crude, 1 and 1 gaunt 1 with 1 travel. 1 But 1 Italy 1 worked 1 some 1 marvel 1 in 1 her. 1 It 1 gave 1 her 1 light, 1 and--which 1 he 1 held 1 more 1 precious--it 1 gave 1 her 1 shadow. 1 Soon 1 he 1 detected 1 in 1 her 1 a 1 wonderful 1 reticence. 1 She 1 was 1 like 1 a 1 woman 1 of 1 Leonardo 1 da 1 Vinci\u2019s, 1 whom 1 we 1 love 1 not 1 so 1 much 1 for 1 herself 1 as 1 for 1 the 1 things 1 that 1 she 1 will 1 not 1 tell 1 us. 1 The 1 things 1 are 1 assuredly 1 not 1 of 1 this 1 life; 1 no 1 woman 1 of 1 Leonardo\u2019s 1 could 1 have 1 anything 1 so 1 vulgar 1 as 1 a 1 \u201cstory.\u201d 1 She 1 did 1 develop 1 most 1 wonderfully 1 day 1 by 1 day. 1 So 1 it 1 happened 1 that 1 from 1 patronizing 1 civility 1 he 1 had 1 slowly 1 passed 1 if 1 not 1 to 1 passion, 1 at 1 least 1 to 1 a 1 profound 1 uneasiness. 1 Already 1 at 1 Rome 1 he 1 had 1 hinted 1 to 1 her 1 that 1 they 1 might 1 be 1 suitable 1 for 1 each 1 other. 1 It 1 had 1 touched 1 him 1 greatly 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 broken 1 away 1 at 1 the 1 suggestion. 1 Her 1 refusal 1 had 1 been 1 clear 1 and 1 gentle; 1 after 1 it--as 1 the 1 horrid 1 phrase 1 went--she 1 had 1 been 1 exactly 1 the 1 same 1 to 1 him 1 as 1 before. 1 Three 1 months 1 later, 1 on 1 the 1 margin 1 of 1 Italy, 1 among 1 the 1 flower-clad 1 Alps, 1 he 1 had 1 asked 1 her 1 again 1 in 1 bald, 1 traditional 1 language. 1 She 1 reminded 1 him 1 of 1 a 1 Leonardo 1 more 1 than 1 ever; 1 her 1 sunburnt 1 features 1 were 1 shadowed 1 by 1 fantastic 1 rock; 1 at 1 his 1 words 1 she 1 had 1 turned 1 and 1 stood 1 between 1 him 1 and 1 the 1 light 1 with 1 immeasurable 1 plains 1 behind 1 her. 1 He 1 walked 1 home 1 with 1 her 1 unashamed, 1 feeling 1 not 1 at 1 all 1 like 1 a 1 rejected 1 suitor. 1 The 1 things 1 that 1 really 1 mattered 1 were 1 unshaken. 1 So 1 now 1 he 1 had 1 asked 1 her 1 once 1 more, 1 and, 1 clear 1 and 1 gentle 1 as 1 ever, 1 she 1 had 1 accepted 1 him, 1 giving 1 no 1 coy 1 reasons 1 for 1 her 1 delay, 1 but 1 simply 1 saying 1 that 1 she 1 loved 1 him 1 and 1 would 1 do 1 her 1 best 1 to 1 make 1 him 1 happy. 1 His 1 mother, 1 too, 1 would 1 be 1 pleased; 1 she 1 had 1 counselled 1 the 1 step; 1 he 1 must 1 write 1 her 1 a 1 long 1 account. 1 Glancing 1 at 1 his 1 hand, 1 in 1 case 1 any 1 of 1 Freddy\u2019s 1 chemicals 1 had 1 come 1 off 1 on 1 it, 1 he 1 moved 1 to 1 the 1 writing 1 table. 1 There 1 he 1 saw 1 \u201cDear 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse,\u201d 1 followed 1 by 1 many 1 erasures. 1 He 1 recoiled 1 without 1 reading 1 any 1 more, 1 and 1 after 1 a 1 little 1 hesitation 1 sat 1 down 1 elsewhere, 1 and 1 pencilled 1 a 1 note 1 on 1 his 1 knee. 1 Then 1 he 1 lit 1 another 1 cigarette, 1 which 1 did 1 not 1 seem 1 quite 1 as 1 divine 1 as 1 the 1 first, 1 and 1 considered 1 what 1 might 1 be 1 done 1 to 1 make 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 drawing-room 1 more 1 distinctive. 1 With 1 that 1 outlook 1 it 1 should 1 have 1 been 1 a 1 successful 1 room, 1 but 1 the 1 trail 1 of 1 Tottenham 1 Court 1 Road 1 was 1 upon 1 it; 1 he 1 could 1 almost 1 visualize 1 the 1 motor-vans 1 of 1 Messrs. 1 Shoolbred 1 and 1 Messrs. 1 Maple 1 arriving 1 at 1 the 1 door 1 and 1 depositing 1 this 1 chair, 1 those 1 varnished 1 book-cases, 1 that 1 writing-table. 1 The 1 table 1 recalled 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch\u2019s 1 letter. 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 want 1 to 1 read 1 that 1 letter--his 1 temptations 1 never 1 lay 1 in 1 that 1 direction; 1 but 1 he 1 worried 1 about 1 it 1 none 1 the 1 less. 1 It 1 was 1 his 1 own 1 fault 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 discussing 1 him 1 with 1 his 1 mother; 1 he 1 had 1 wanted 1 her 1 support 1 in 1 his 1 third 1 attempt 1 to 1 win 1 Lucy; 1 he 1 wanted 1 to 1 feel 1 that 1 others, 1 no 1 matter 1 who 1 they 1 were, 1 agreed 1 with 1 him, 1 and 1 so 1 he 1 had 1 asked 1 their 1 permission. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 had 1 been 1 civil, 1 but 1 obtuse 1 in 1 essentials, 1 while 1 as 1 for 1 Freddy--\u201cHe 1 is 1 only 1 a 1 boy,\u201d 1 he 1 reflected. 1 \u201cI 1 represent 1 all 1 that 1 he 1 despises. 1 Why 1 should 1 he 1 want 1 me 1 for 1 a 1 brother-in-law?\u201d 1 The 1 Honeychurches 1 were 1 a 1 worthy 1 family, 1 but 1 he 1 began 1 to 1 realize 1 that 1 Lucy 1 was 1 of 1 another 1 clay; 1 and 1 perhaps--he 1 did 1 not 1 put 1 it 1 very 1 definitely--he 1 ought 1 to 1 introduce 1 her 1 into 1 more 1 congenial 1 circles 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 possible. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe!\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 maid, 1 and 1 the 1 new 1 rector 1 of 1 Summer 1 Street 1 was 1 shown 1 in; 1 he 1 had 1 at 1 once 1 started 1 on 1 friendly 1 relations, 1 owing 1 to 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 praise 1 of 1 him 1 in 1 her 1 letters 1 from 1 Florence. 1 Cecil 1 greeted 1 him 1 rather 1 critically. 1 \u201cI\u2019ve 1 come 1 for 1 tea, 1 Mr. 1 Vyse. 1 Do 1 you 1 suppose 1 that 1 I 1 shall 1 get 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 should 1 say 1 so. 1 Food 1 is 1 the 1 thing 1 one 1 does 1 get 1 here--Don\u2019t 1 sit 1 in 1 that 1 chair; 1 young 1 Honeychurch 1 has 1 left 1 a 1 bone 1 in 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cPfui!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 know,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cI 1 know. 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 think 1 why 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 allows 1 it.\u201d 1 For 1 Cecil 1 considered 1 the 1 bone 1 and 1 the 1 Maples\u2019 1 furniture 1 separately; 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 realize 1 that, 1 taken 1 together, 1 they 1 kindled 1 the 1 room 1 into 1 the 1 life 1 that 1 he 1 desired. 1 \u201cI\u2019ve 1 come 1 for 1 tea 1 and 1 for 1 gossip. 1 Isn\u2019t 1 this 1 news?\u201d 1 \u201cNews? 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 understand 1 you,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cNews?\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 whose 1 news 1 was 1 of 1 a 1 very 1 different 1 nature, 1 prattled 1 forward. 1 \u201cI 1 met 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway 1 as 1 I 1 came 1 up; 1 I 1 have 1 every 1 reason 1 to 1 hope 1 that 1 I 1 am 1 first 1 in 1 the 1 field. 1 He 1 has 1 bought 1 Cissie 1 and 1 Albert 1 from 1 Mr. 1 Flack!\u201d 1 \u201cHas 1 he 1 indeed?\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 trying 1 to 1 recover 1 himself. 1 Into 1 what 1 a 1 grotesque 1 mistake 1 had 1 he 1 fallen! 1 Was 1 it 1 likely 1 that 1 a 1 clergyman 1 and 1 a 1 gentleman 1 would 1 refer 1 to 1 his 1 engagement 1 in 1 a 1 manner 1 so 1 flippant? 1 But 1 his 1 stiffness 1 remained, 1 and, 1 though 1 he 1 asked 1 who 1 Cissie 1 and 1 Albert 1 might 1 be, 1 he 1 still 1 thought 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 rather 1 a 1 bounder. 1 \u201cUnpardonable 1 question! 1 To 1 have 1 stopped 1 a 1 week 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 and 1 not 1 to 1 have 1 met 1 Cissie 1 and 1 Albert, 1 the 1 semi-detached 1 villas 1 that 1 have 1 been 1 run 1 up 1 opposite 1 the 1 church! 1 I\u2019ll 1 set 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 after 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 shockingly 1 stupid 1 over 1 local 1 affairs,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 young 1 man 1 languidly. 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 even 1 remember 1 the 1 difference 1 between 1 a 1 Parish 1 Council 1 and 1 a 1 Local 1 Government 1 Board. 1 Perhaps 1 there 1 is 1 no 1 difference, 1 or 1 perhaps 1 those 1 aren\u2019t 1 the 1 right 1 names. 1 I 1 only 1 go 1 into 1 the 1 country 1 to 1 see 1 my 1 friends 1 and 1 to 1 enjoy 1 the 1 scenery. 1 It 1 is 1 very 1 remiss 1 of 1 me. 1 Italy 1 and 1 London 1 are 1 the 1 only 1 places 1 where 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 feel 1 to 1 exist 1 on 1 sufferance.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 distressed 1 at 1 this 1 heavy 1 reception 1 of 1 Cissie 1 and 1 Albert, 1 determined 1 to 1 shift 1 the 1 subject. 1 \u201cLet 1 me 1 see, 1 Mr. 1 Vyse--I 1 forget--what 1 is 1 your 1 profession?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 no 1 profession,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 another 1 example 1 of 1 my 1 decadence. 1 My 1 attitude--quite 1 an 1 indefensible 1 one--is 1 that 1 so 1 long 1 as 1 I 1 am 1 no 1 trouble 1 to 1 any 1 one 1 I 1 have 1 a 1 right 1 to 1 do 1 as 1 I 1 like. 1 I 1 know 1 I 1 ought 1 to 1 be 1 getting 1 money 1 out 1 of 1 people, 1 or 1 devoting 1 myself 1 to 1 things 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 care 1 a 1 straw 1 about, 1 but 1 somehow, 1 I\u2019ve 1 not 1 been 1 able 1 to 1 begin.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 are 1 very 1 fortunate,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 a 1 wonderful 1 opportunity, 1 the 1 possession 1 of 1 leisure.\u201d 1 His 1 voice 1 was 1 rather 1 parochial, 1 but 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 quite 1 see 1 his 1 way 1 to 1 answering 1 naturally. 1 He 1 felt, 1 as 1 all 1 who 1 have 1 regular 1 occupation 1 must 1 feel, 1 that 1 others 1 should 1 have 1 it 1 also. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 glad 1 that 1 you 1 approve. 1 I 1 daren\u2019t 1 face 1 the 1 healthy 1 person--for 1 example, 1 Freddy 1 Honeychurch.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Freddy\u2019s 1 a 1 good 1 sort, 1 isn\u2019t 1 he?\u201d 1 \u201cAdmirable. 1 The 1 sort 1 who 1 has 1 made 1 England 1 what 1 she 1 is.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 wondered 1 at 1 himself. 1 Why, 1 on 1 this 1 day 1 of 1 all 1 others, 1 was 1 he 1 so 1 hopelessly 1 contrary? 1 He 1 tried 1 to 1 get 1 right 1 by 1 inquiring 1 effusively 1 after 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 mother, 1 an 1 old 1 lady 1 for 1 whom 1 he 1 had 1 no 1 particular 1 regard. 1 Then 1 he 1 flattered 1 the 1 clergyman, 1 praised 1 his 1 liberal-mindedness, 1 his 1 enlightened 1 attitude 1 towards 1 philosophy 1 and 1 science. 1 \u201cWhere 1 are 1 the 1 others?\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 at 1 last, 1 \u201cI 1 insist 1 on 1 extracting 1 tea 1 before 1 evening 1 service.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 suppose 1 Anne 1 never 1 told 1 them 1 you 1 were 1 here. 1 In 1 this 1 house 1 one 1 is 1 so 1 coached 1 in 1 the 1 servants 1 the 1 day 1 one 1 arrives. 1 The 1 fault 1 of 1 Anne 1 is 1 that 1 she 1 begs 1 your 1 pardon 1 when 1 she 1 hears 1 you 1 perfectly, 1 and 1 kicks 1 the 1 chair-legs 1 with 1 her 1 feet. 1 The 1 faults 1 of 1 Mary--I 1 forget 1 the 1 faults 1 of 1 Mary, 1 but 1 they 1 are 1 very 1 grave. 1 Shall 1 we 1 look 1 in 1 the 1 garden?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 know 1 the 1 faults 1 of 1 Mary. 1 She 1 leaves 1 the 1 dust-pans 1 standing 1 on 1 the 1 stairs.\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 fault 1 of 1 Euphemia 1 is 1 that 1 she 1 will 1 not, 1 simply 1 will 1 not, 1 chop 1 the 1 suet 1 sufficiently 1 small.\u201d 1 They 1 both 1 laughed, 1 and 1 things 1 began 1 to 1 go 1 better. 1 \u201cThe 1 faults 1 of 1 Freddy--\u201d 1 Cecil 1 continued. 1 \u201cAh, 1 he 1 has 1 too 1 many. 1 No 1 one 1 but 1 his 1 mother 1 can 1 remember 1 the 1 faults 1 of 1 Freddy. 1 Try 1 the 1 faults 1 of 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch; 1 they 1 are 1 not 1 innumerable.\u201d 1 \u201cShe 1 has 1 none,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 young 1 man, 1 with 1 grave 1 sincerity. 1 \u201cI 1 quite 1 agree. 1 At 1 present 1 she 1 has 1 none.\u201d 1 \u201cAt 1 present?\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 not 1 cynical. 1 I\u2019m 1 only 1 thinking 1 of 1 my 1 pet 1 theory 1 about 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch. 1 Does 1 it 1 seem 1 reasonable 1 that 1 she 1 should 1 play 1 so 1 wonderfully, 1 and 1 live 1 so 1 quietly? 1 I 1 suspect 1 that 1 one 1 day 1 she 1 will 1 be 1 wonderful 1 in 1 both. 1 The 1 water-tight 1 compartments 1 in 1 her 1 will 1 break 1 down, 1 and 1 music 1 and 1 life 1 will 1 mingle. 1 Then 1 we 1 shall 1 have 1 her 1 heroically 1 good, 1 heroically 1 bad--too 1 heroic, 1 perhaps, 1 to 1 be 1 good 1 or 1 bad.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 found 1 his 1 companion 1 interesting. 1 \u201cAnd 1 at 1 present 1 you 1 think 1 her 1 not 1 wonderful 1 as 1 far 1 as 1 life 1 goes?\u201d 1 \u201cWell, 1 I 1 must 1 say 1 I\u2019ve 1 only 1 seen 1 her 1 at 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells, 1 where 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 wonderful, 1 and 1 at 1 Florence. 1 Since 1 I 1 came 1 to 1 Summer 1 Street 1 she 1 has 1 been 1 away. 1 You 1 saw 1 her, 1 didn\u2019t 1 you, 1 at 1 Rome 1 and 1 in 1 the 1 Alps. 1 Oh, 1 I 1 forgot; 1 of 1 course, 1 you 1 knew 1 her 1 before. 1 No, 1 she 1 wasn\u2019t 1 wonderful 1 in 1 Florence 1 either, 1 but 1 I 1 kept 1 on 1 expecting 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 be.\u201d 1 \u201cIn 1 what 1 way?\u201d 1 Conversation 1 had 1 become 1 agreeable 1 to 1 them, 1 and 1 they 1 were 1 pacing 1 up 1 and 1 down 1 the 1 terrace. 1 \u201cI 1 could 1 as 1 easily 1 tell 1 you 1 what 1 tune 1 she\u2019ll 1 play 1 next. 1 There 1 was 1 simply 1 the 1 sense 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 found 1 wings, 1 and 1 meant 1 to 1 use 1 them. 1 I 1 can 1 show 1 you 1 a 1 beautiful 1 picture 1 in 1 my 1 Italian 1 diary: 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 as 1 a 1 kite, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 holding 1 the 1 string. 1 Picture 1 number 1 two: 1 the 1 string 1 breaks.\u201d 1 The 1 sketch 1 was 1 in 1 his 1 diary, 1 but 1 it 1 had 1 been 1 made 1 afterwards, 1 when 1 he 1 viewed 1 things 1 artistically. 1 At 1 the 1 time 1 he 1 had 1 given 1 surreptitious 1 tugs 1 to 1 the 1 string 1 himself. 1 \u201cBut 1 the 1 string 1 never 1 broke?\u201d 1 \u201cNo. 1 I 1 mightn\u2019t 1 have 1 seen 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 rise, 1 but 1 I 1 should 1 certainly 1 have 1 heard 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 fall.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 has 1 broken 1 now,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 young 1 man 1 in 1 low, 1 vibrating 1 tones. 1 Immediately 1 he 1 realized 1 that 1 of 1 all 1 the 1 conceited, 1 ludicrous, 1 contemptible 1 ways 1 of 1 announcing 1 an 1 engagement 1 this 1 was 1 the 1 worst. 1 He 1 cursed 1 his 1 love 1 of 1 metaphor; 1 had 1 he 1 suggested 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 a 1 star 1 and 1 that 1 Lucy 1 was 1 soaring 1 up 1 to 1 reach 1 him? 1 \u201cBroken? 1 What 1 do 1 you 1 mean?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 meant,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil 1 stiffly, 1 \u201cthat 1 she 1 is 1 going 1 to 1 marry 1 me.\u201d 1 The 1 clergyman 1 was 1 conscious 1 of 1 some 1 bitter 1 disappointment 1 which 1 he 1 could 1 not 1 keep 1 out 1 of 1 his 1 voice. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 sorry; 1 I 1 must 1 apologize. 1 I 1 had 1 no 1 idea 1 you 1 were 1 intimate 1 with 1 her, 1 or 1 I 1 should 1 never 1 have 1 talked 1 in 1 this 1 flippant, 1 superficial 1 way. 1 Mr. 1 Vyse, 1 you 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 stopped 1 me.\u201d 1 And 1 down 1 the 1 garden 1 he 1 saw 1 Lucy 1 herself; 1 yes, 1 he 1 was 1 disappointed. 1 Cecil, 1 the 1 house 1 is 1 not 1 AT 1 ALL 1 what 1 it 1 was 1 yesterday.\u201d 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 be 1 a 1 prig,\u201d 1 said 1 her 1 Uncle 1 Arthur. 1 \u201cGo 1 and 1 put 1 on 1 your 1 boots.\u201d 1 He 1 stepped 1 into 1 the 1 drawing-room, 1 where 1 Lucy 1 was 1 still 1 attentively 1 pursuing 1 the 1 Sonatas 1 of 1 Mozart. 1 She 1 stopped 1 when 1 he 1 entered. 1 \u201cHow 1 do 1 you 1 do? 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 and 1 Minnie 1 are 1 coming 1 with 1 me 1 to 1 tea 1 at 1 the 1 Beehive. 1 Would 1 you 1 come 1 too?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 think 1 I 1 will, 1 thank 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 suppose 1 you 1 would 1 care 1 to 1 much.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 turned 1 to 1 the 1 piano 1 and 1 struck 1 a 1 few 1 chords. 1 \u201cHow 1 delicate 1 those 1 Sonatas 1 are!\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 though 1 at 1 the 1 bottom 1 of 1 his 1 heart, 1 he 1 thought 1 them 1 silly 1 little 1 things. 1 Lucy 1 passed 1 into 1 Schumann. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch!\u201d 1 \u201cYes.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 met 1 them 1 on 1 the 1 hill. 1 Your 1 brother 1 told 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cOh 1 he 1 did?\u201d 1 She 1 sounded 1 annoyed. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 felt 1 hurt, 1 for 1 he 1 had 1 thought 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 like 1 him 1 to 1 be 1 told. 1 \u201cI 1 needn\u2019t 1 say 1 that 1 it 1 will 1 go 1 no 1 further.\u201d 1 \u201cMother, 1 Charlotte, 1 Cecil, 1 Freddy, 1 you,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 playing 1 a 1 note 1 for 1 each 1 person 1 who 1 knew, 1 and 1 then 1 playing 1 a 1 sixth 1 note. 1 \u201cIf 1 you\u2019ll 1 let 1 me 1 say 1 so, 1 I 1 am 1 very 1 glad, 1 and 1 I 1 am 1 certain 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 done 1 the 1 right 1 thing.\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 I 1 hoped 1 other 1 people 1 would 1 think, 1 but 1 they 1 don\u2019t 1 seem 1 to.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 could 1 see 1 that 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 thought 1 it 1 unwise.\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 does 1 mother. 1 Mother 1 minds 1 dreadfully.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 very 1 sorry 1 for 1 that,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 with 1 feeling. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 who 1 hated 1 all 1 changes, 1 did 1 mind, 1 but 1 not 1 nearly 1 as 1 much 1 as 1 her 1 daughter 1 pretended, 1 and 1 only 1 for 1 the 1 minute. 1 It 1 was 1 really 1 a 1 ruse 1 of 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 to 1 justify 1 her 1 despondency--a 1 ruse 1 of 1 which 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 herself 1 conscious, 1 for 1 she 1 was 1 marching 1 in 1 the 1 armies 1 of 1 darkness. 1 \u201cAnd 1 Freddy 1 minds.\u201d 1 \u201cStill, 1 Freddy 1 never 1 hit 1 it 1 off 1 with 1 Vyse 1 much, 1 did 1 he? 1 I 1 gathered 1 that 1 he 1 disliked 1 the 1 engagement, 1 and 1 felt 1 it 1 might 1 separate 1 him 1 from 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cBoys 1 are 1 so 1 odd.\u201d 1 Minnie 1 could 1 be 1 heard 1 arguing 1 with 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 through 1 the 1 floor. 1 Tea 1 at 1 the 1 Beehive 1 apparently 1 involved 1 a 1 complete 1 change 1 of 1 apparel. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 saw 1 that 1 Lucy--very 1 properly--did 1 not 1 wish 1 to 1 discuss 1 her 1 action, 1 so 1 after 1 a 1 sincere 1 expression 1 of 1 sympathy, 1 he 1 said, 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 had 1 an 1 absurd 1 letter 1 from 1 Miss 1 Alan. 1 That 1 was 1 really 1 what 1 brought 1 me 1 over. 1 I 1 thought 1 it 1 might 1 amuse 1 you 1 all.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 delightful!\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 in 1 a 1 dull 1 voice. 1 For 1 the 1 sake 1 of 1 something 1 to 1 do, 1 he 1 began 1 to 1 read 1 her 1 the 1 letter. 1 After 1 a 1 few 1 words 1 her 1 eyes 1 grew 1 alert, 1 and 1 soon 1 she 1 interrupted 1 him 1 with 1 \u201cGoing 1 abroad? 1 When 1 do 1 they 1 start?\u201d 1 \u201cNext 1 week, 1 I 1 gather.\u201d 1 \u201cDid 1 Freddy 1 say 1 whether 1 he 1 was 1 driving 1 straight 1 back?\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 he 1 didn\u2019t.\u201d 1 \u201cBecause 1 I 1 do 1 hope 1 he 1 won\u2019t 1 go 1 gossiping.\u201d 1 So 1 she 1 did 1 want 1 to 1 talk 1 about 1 her 1 broken 1 engagement. 1 Always 1 complaisant, 1 he 1 put 1 the 1 letter 1 away. 1 But 1 she, 1 at 1 once 1 exclaimed 1 in 1 a 1 high 1 voice, 1 \u201cOh, 1 do 1 tell 1 me 1 more 1 about 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans! 1 How 1 perfectly 1 splendid 1 of 1 them 1 to 1 go 1 abroad!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 want 1 them 1 to 1 start 1 from 1 Venice, 1 and 1 go 1 in 1 a 1 cargo 1 steamer 1 down 1 the 1 Illyrian 1 coast!\u201d 1 She 1 laughed 1 heartily. 1 \u201cOh, 1 delightful! 1 I 1 wish 1 they\u2019d 1 take 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cHas 1 Italy 1 filled 1 you 1 with 1 the 1 fever 1 of 1 travel? 1 Perhaps 1 George 1 Emerson 1 is 1 right. 1 He 1 says 1 that 1 \u2018Italy 1 is 1 only 1 an 1 euphuism 1 for 1 Fate.\u2019\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 not 1 Italy, 1 but 1 Constantinople. 1 I 1 have 1 always 1 longed 1 to 1 go 1 to 1 Constantinople. 1 Constantinople 1 is 1 practically 1 Asia, 1 isn\u2019t 1 it?\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 reminded 1 her 1 that 1 Constantinople 1 was 1 still 1 unlikely, 1 and 1 that 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 only 1 aimed 1 at 1 Athens, 1 \u201cwith 1 Delphi, 1 perhaps, 1 if 1 the 1 roads 1 are 1 safe.\u201d 1 But 1 this 1 made 1 no 1 difference 1 to 1 her 1 enthusiasm. 1 She 1 had 1 always 1 longed 1 to 1 go 1 to 1 Greece 1 even 1 more, 1 it 1 seemed. 1 He 1 saw, 1 to 1 his 1 surprise, 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 apparently 1 serious. 1 \u201cI 1 didn\u2019t 1 realize 1 that 1 you 1 and 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 were 1 still 1 such 1 friends, 1 after 1 Cissie 1 Villa.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 that\u2019s 1 nothing; 1 I 1 assure 1 you 1 Cissie 1 Villa\u2019s 1 nothing 1 to 1 me; 1 I 1 would 1 give 1 anything 1 to 1 go 1 with 1 them.\u201d 1 \u201cWould 1 your 1 mother 1 spare 1 you 1 again 1 so 1 soon? 1 You 1 have 1 scarcely 1 been 1 home 1 three 1 months.\u201d 1 \u201cShe 1 MUST 1 spare 1 me!\u201d 1 cried 1 Lucy, 1 in 1 growing 1 excitement. 1 \u201cI 1 simply 1 MUST 1 go 1 away. 1 I 1 have 1 to.\u201d 1 She 1 ran 1 her 1 fingers 1 hysterically 1 through 1 her 1 hair. 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 you 1 see 1 that 1 I 1 HAVE 1 to 1 go 1 away? 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 realize 1 at 1 the 1 time--and 1 of 1 course 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 see 1 Constantinople 1 so 1 particularly.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 mean 1 that 1 since 1 you 1 have 1 broken 1 off 1 your 1 engagement 1 you 1 feel--\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 yes. 1 I 1 knew 1 you\u2019d 1 understand.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 did 1 not 1 quite 1 understand. 1 Why 1 could 1 not 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 repose 1 in 1 the 1 bosom 1 of 1 her 1 family? 1 Cecil 1 had 1 evidently 1 taken 1 up 1 the 1 dignified 1 line, 1 and 1 was 1 not 1 going 1 to 1 annoy 1 her. 1 Then 1 it 1 struck 1 him 1 that 1 her 1 family 1 itself 1 might 1 be 1 annoying. 1 He 1 hinted 1 this 1 to 1 her, 1 and 1 she 1 accepted 1 the 1 hint 1 eagerly. 1 \u201cYes, 1 of 1 course; 1 to 1 go 1 to 1 Constantinople 1 until 1 they 1 are 1 used 1 to 1 the 1 idea 1 and 1 everything 1 has 1 calmed 1 down.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 afraid 1 it 1 has 1 been 1 a 1 bothersome 1 business,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 gently. 1 \u201cNo, 1 not 1 at 1 all. 1 Cecil 1 was 1 very 1 kind 1 indeed; 1 only--I 1 had 1 better 1 tell 1 you 1 the 1 whole 1 truth, 1 since 1 you 1 have 1 heard 1 a 1 little--it 1 was 1 that 1 he 1 is 1 so 1 masterful. 1 I 1 found 1 that 1 he 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 let 1 me 1 go 1 my 1 own 1 way. 1 He 1 would 1 improve 1 me 1 in 1 places 1 where 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 be 1 improved. 1 Cecil 1 won\u2019t 1 let 1 a 1 woman 1 decide 1 for 1 herself--in 1 fact, 1 he 1 daren\u2019t. 1 What 1 nonsense 1 I 1 do 1 talk! 1 But 1 that 1 is 1 the 1 kind 1 of 1 thing.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 what 1 I 1 gathered 1 from 1 my 1 own 1 observation 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Vyse; 1 it 1 is 1 what 1 I 1 gather 1 from 1 all 1 that 1 I 1 have 1 known 1 of 1 you. 1 I 1 do 1 sympathize 1 and 1 agree 1 most 1 profoundly. 1 I 1 agree 1 so 1 much 1 that 1 you 1 must 1 let 1 me 1 make 1 one 1 little 1 criticism: 1 Is 1 it 1 worth 1 while 1 rushing 1 off 1 to 1 Greece?\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 I 1 must 1 go 1 somewhere!\u201d 1 she 1 cried. 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 been 1 worrying 1 all 1 the 1 morning, 1 and 1 here 1 comes 1 the 1 very 1 thing.\u201d 1 She 1 struck 1 her 1 knees 1 with 1 clenched 1 fists, 1 and 1 repeated: 1 \u201cI 1 must! 1 And 1 the 1 time 1 I 1 shall 1 have 1 with 1 mother, 1 and 1 all 1 the 1 money 1 she 1 spent 1 on 1 me 1 last 1 spring. 1 You 1 all 1 think 1 much 1 too 1 highly 1 of 1 me. 1 I 1 wish 1 you 1 weren\u2019t 1 so 1 kind.\u201d 1 At 1 this 1 moment 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 entered, 1 and 1 her 1 nervousness 1 increased. 1 \u201cI 1 must 1 get 1 away, 1 ever 1 so 1 far. 1 I 1 must 1 know 1 my 1 own 1 mind 1 and 1 where 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 go.\u201d 1 \u201cCome 1 along; 1 tea, 1 tea, 1 tea,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 and 1 bustled 1 his 1 guests 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 front-door. 1 He 1 hustled 1 them 1 so 1 quickly 1 that 1 he 1 forgot 1 his 1 hat. 1 When 1 he 1 returned 1 for 1 it 1 he 1 heard, 1 to 1 his 1 relief 1 and 1 surprise, 1 the 1 tinkling 1 of 1 a 1 Mozart 1 Sonata. 1 \u201cShe 1 is 1 playing 1 again,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 to 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cLucy 1 can 1 always 1 play,\u201d 1 was 1 the 1 acid 1 reply. 1 \u201cOne 1 is 1 very 1 thankful 1 that 1 she 1 has 1 such 1 a 1 resource. 1 She 1 is 1 evidently 1 much 1 worried, 1 as, 1 of 1 course, 1 she 1 ought 1 to 1 be. 1 I 1 know 1 all 1 about 1 it. 1 The 1 marriage 1 was 1 so 1 near 1 that 1 it 1 must 1 have 1 been 1 a 1 hard 1 struggle 1 before 1 she 1 could 1 wind 1 herself 1 up 1 to 1 speak.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 gave 1 a 1 kind 1 of 1 wriggle, 1 and 1 he 1 prepared 1 for 1 a 1 discussion. 1 He 1 had 1 never 1 fathomed 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 As 1 he 1 had 1 put 1 it 1 to 1 himself 1 at 1 Florence, 1 \u201cshe 1 might 1 yet 1 reveal 1 depths 1 of 1 strangeness, 1 if 1 not 1 of 1 meaning.\u201d 1 But 1 she 1 was 1 so 1 unsympathetic 1 that 1 she 1 must 1 be 1 reliable. 1 He 1 assumed 1 that 1 much, 1 and 1 he 1 had 1 no 1 hesitation 1 in 1 discussing 1 Lucy 1 with 1 her. 1 Minnie 1 was 1 fortunately 1 collecting 1 ferns. 1 She 1 opened 1 the 1 discussion 1 with: 1 \u201cWe 1 had 1 much 1 better 1 let 1 the 1 matter 1 drop.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 wonder.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 of 1 the 1 highest 1 importance 1 that 1 there 1 should 1 be 1 no 1 gossip 1 in 1 Summer 1 Street. 1 It 1 would 1 be 1 DEATH 1 to 1 gossip 1 about 1 Mr. 1 Vyse\u2019s 1 dismissal 1 at 1 the 1 present 1 moment.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 raised 1 his 1 eyebrows. 1 Death 1 is 1 a 1 strong 1 word--surely 1 too 1 strong. 1 There 1 was 1 no 1 question 1 of 1 tragedy. 1 He 1 said: 1 \u201cOf 1 course, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 will 1 make 1 the 1 fact 1 public 1 in 1 her 1 own 1 way, 1 and 1 when 1 she 1 chooses. 1 Freddy 1 only 1 told 1 me 1 because 1 he 1 knew 1 she 1 would 1 not 1 mind.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 know,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 civilly. 1 \u201cYet 1 Freddy 1 ought 1 not 1 to 1 have 1 told 1 even 1 you. 1 One 1 cannot 1 be 1 too 1 careful.\u201d 1 \u201cQuite 1 so.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 do 1 implore 1 absolute 1 secrecy. 1 A 1 chance 1 word 1 to 1 a 1 chattering 1 friend, 1 and--\u201d 1 \u201cExactly.\u201d 1 He 1 was 1 used 1 to 1 these 1 nervous 1 old 1 maids 1 and 1 to 1 the 1 exaggerated 1 importance 1 that 1 they 1 attach 1 to 1 words. 1 A 1 rector 1 lives 1 in 1 a 1 web 1 of 1 petty 1 secrets, 1 and 1 confidences 1 and 1 warnings, 1 and 1 the 1 wiser 1 he 1 is 1 the 1 less 1 he 1 will 1 regard 1 them. 1 He 1 will 1 change 1 the 1 subject, 1 as 1 did 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 saying 1 cheerfully: 1 \u201cHave 1 you 1 heard 1 from 1 any 1 Bertolini 1 people 1 lately? 1 I 1 believe 1 you 1 keep 1 up 1 with 1 Miss 1 Lavish. 1 It 1 is 1 odd 1 how 1 we 1 of 1 that 1 pension, 1 who 1 seemed 1 such 1 a 1 fortuitous 1 collection, 1 have 1 been 1 working 1 into 1 one 1 another\u2019s 1 lives. 1 Two, 1 three, 1 four, 1 six 1 of 1 us--no, 1 eight; 1 I 1 had 1 forgotten 1 the 1 Emersons--have 1 kept 1 more 1 or 1 less 1 in 1 touch. 1 We 1 must 1 really 1 give 1 the 1 Signora 1 a 1 testimonial.\u201d 1 And, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 not 1 favouring 1 the 1 scheme, 1 they 1 walked 1 up 1 the 1 hill 1 in 1 a 1 silence 1 which 1 was 1 only 1 broken 1 by 1 the 1 rector 1 naming 1 some 1 fern. 1 On 1 the 1 summit 1 they 1 paused. 1 The 1 sky 1 had 1 grown 1 wilder 1 since 1 he 1 stood 1 there 1 last 1 hour, 1 giving 1 to 1 the 1 land 1 a 1 tragic 1 greatness 1 that 1 is 1 rare 1 in 1 Surrey. 1 Grey 1 clouds 1 were 1 charging 1 across 1 tissues 1 of 1 white, 1 which 1 stretched 1 and 1 shredded 1 and 1 tore 1 slowly, 1 until 1 through 1 their 1 final 1 layers 1 there 1 gleamed 1 a 1 hint 1 of 1 the 1 disappearing 1 blue. 1 Summer 1 was 1 retreating. 1 The 1 wind 1 roared, 1 the 1 trees 1 groaned, 1 yet 1 the 1 noise 1 seemed 1 insufficient 1 for 1 those 1 vast 1 operations 1 in 1 heaven. 1 The 1 weather 1 was 1 breaking 1 up, 1 breaking, 1 broken, 1 and 1 it 1 is 1 a 1 sense 1 of 1 the 1 fit 1 rather 1 than 1 of 1 the 1 supernatural 1 that 1 equips 1 such 1 crises 1 with 1 the 1 salvos 1 of 1 angelic 1 artillery. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 eyes 1 rested 1 on 1 Windy 1 Corner, 1 where 1 Lucy 1 sat, 1 practising 1 Mozart. 1 No 1 smile 1 came 1 to 1 his 1 lips, 1 and, 1 changing 1 the 1 subject 1 again, 1 he 1 said: 1 \u201cWe 1 shan\u2019t 1 have 1 rain, 1 but 1 we 1 shall 1 have 1 darkness, 1 so 1 let 1 us 1 hurry 1 on. 1 The 1 darkness 1 last 1 night 1 was 1 appalling.\u201d 1 They 1 reached 1 the 1 Beehive 1 Tavern 1 at 1 about 1 five 1 o\u2019clock. 1 That 1 amiable 1 hostelry 1 possesses 1 a 1 verandah, 1 in 1 which 1 the 1 young 1 and 1 the 1 unwise 1 do 1 dearly 1 love 1 to 1 sit, 1 while 1 guests 1 of 1 more 1 mature 1 years 1 seek 1 a 1 pleasant 1 sanded 1 room, 1 and 1 have 1 tea 1 at 1 a 1 table 1 comfortably. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 saw 1 that 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 would 1 be 1 cold 1 if 1 she 1 sat 1 out, 1 and 1 that 1 Minnie 1 would 1 be 1 dull 1 if 1 she 1 sat 1 in, 1 so 1 he 1 proposed 1 a 1 division 1 of 1 forces. 1 They 1 would 1 hand 1 the 1 child 1 her 1 food 1 through 1 the 1 window. 1 Thus 1 he 1 was 1 incidentally 1 enabled 1 to 1 discuss 1 the 1 fortunes 1 of 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 been 1 thinking, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett,\u201d 1 he 1 strolled 1 to 1 the 1 window, 1 opened 1 it 1 (as 1 the 1 English 1 will), 1 and 1 leant 1 out. 1 There 1 was 1 the 1 parapet, 1 there 1 the 1 river, 1 there 1 to 1 the 1 left 1 the 1 beginnings 1 of 1 the 1 hills. 1 The 1 cab-driver, 1 who 1 at 1 once 1 saluted 1 him 1 with 1 the 1 hiss 1 of 1 a 1 serpent, 1 might 1 be 1 that 1 very 1 Phaethon 1 who 1 had 1 set 1 this 1 happiness 1 in 1 motion 1 twelve 1 months 1 ago. 1 A 1 passion 1 of 1 gratitude--all 1 feelings 1 grow 1 to 1 passions 1 in 1 the 1 South--came 1 over 1 the 1 husband, 1 and 1 he 1 blessed 1 the 1 people 1 and 1 the 1 things 1 who 1 had 1 taken 1 so 1 much 1 trouble 1 about 1 a 1 young 1 fool. 1 He 1 had 1 helped 1 himself, 1 it 1 is 1 true, 1 but 1 how 1 stupidly! 1 All 1 the 1 fighting 1 that 1 mattered 1 had 1 been 1 done 1 by 1 others--by 1 Italy, 1 by 1 his 1 father, 1 by 1 his 1 wife. 1 \u201cLucy, 1 you 1 come 1 and 1 look 1 at 1 the 1 cypresses; 1 and 1 the 1 church, 1 whatever 1 its 1 name 1 is, 1 still 1 shows.\u201d 1 \u201cSan 1 Miniato. 1 I\u2019ll 1 just 1 finish 1 your 1 sock.\u201d 1 \u201cSignorino, 1 domani 1 faremo 1 uno 1 giro,\u201d 1 called 1 the 1 cabman, 1 with 1 engaging 1 certainty. 1 George 1 told 1 him 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 mistaken; 1 they 1 had 1 no 1 money 1 to 1 throw 1 away 1 on 1 driving. 1 And 1 the 1 people 1 who 1 had 1 not 1 meant 1 to 1 help--the 1 Miss 1 Lavishes, 1 the 1 Cecils, 1 the 1 Miss 1 Bartletts! 1 Ever 1 prone 1 to 1 magnify 1 Fate, 1 George 1 counted 1 up 1 the 1 forces 1 that 1 had 1 swept 1 him 1 into 1 this 1 contentment. 1 \u201cAnything 1 good 1 in 1 Freddy\u2019s 1 letter?\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 yet.\u201d 1 His 1 own 1 content 1 was 1 absolute, 1 but 1 hers 1 held 1 bitterness: 1 the 1 Honeychurches 1 had 1 not 1 forgiven 1 them; 1 they 1 were 1 disgusted 1 at 1 her 1 past 1 hypocrisy; 1 she 1 had 1 alienated 1 Windy 1 Corner, 1 perhaps 1 for 1 ever. 1 \u201cWhat 1 does 1 he 1 say?\u201d 1 \u201cSilly 1 boy! 1 He 1 thinks 1 he\u2019s 1 being 1 dignified. 1 He 1 knew 1 we 1 should 1 go 1 off 1 in 1 the 1 spring--he 1 has 1 known 1 it 1 for 1 six 1 months--that 1 if 1 mother 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 give 1 her 1 consent 1 we 1 should 1 take 1 the 1 thing 1 into 1 our 1 own 1 hands. 1 They 1 had 1 fair 1 warning, 1 and 1 now 1 he 1 calls 1 it 1 an 1 elopement. 1 Ridiculous 1 boy--\u201d 1 \u201cSignorino, 1 domani 1 faremo 1 uno 1 giro--\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 it 1 will 1 all 1 come 1 right 1 in 1 the 1 end. 1 He 1 has 1 to 1 build 1 us 1 both 1 up 1 from 1 the 1 beginning 1 again. 1 I 1 wish, 1 though, 1 that 1 Cecil 1 had 1 not 1 turned 1 so 1 cynical 1 about 1 women. 1 He 1 has, 1 for 1 the 1 second 1 time, 1 quite 1 altered. 1 Why 1 will 1 men 1 have 1 theories 1 about 1 women? 1 I 1 haven\u2019t 1 any 1 about 1 men. 1 I 1 wish, 1 too, 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Beebe--\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 may 1 well 1 wish 1 that.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 will 1 never 1 forgive 1 us--I 1 mean, 1 he 1 will 1 never 1 be 1 interested 1 in 1 us 1 again. 1 I 1 wish 1 that 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 influence 1 them 1 so 1 much 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner. 1 I 1 wish 1 he 1 hadn\u2019t--But 1 if 1 we 1 act 1 the 1 truth, 1 the 1 people 1 who 1 really 1 love 1 us 1 are 1 sure 1 to 1 come 1 back 1 to 1 us 1 in 1 the 1 long 1 run.\u201d 1 \u201cPerhaps.\u201d 1 Then 1 he 1 said 1 more 1 gently: 1 \u201cWell, 1 I 1 acted 1 the 1 truth--the 1 only 1 thing 1 I 1 did 1 do--and 1 you 1 came 1 back 1 to 1 me. 1 So 1 possibly 1 you 1 know.\u201d 1 He 1 turned 1 back 1 into 1 the 1 room. 1 \u201cNonsense 1 with 1 that 1 sock.\u201d 1 He 1 carried 1 her 1 to 1 the 1 window, 1 so 1 that 1 she, 1 too, 1 saw 1 all 1 the 1 view. 1 They 1 sank 1 upon 1 their 1 knees, 1 invisible 1 from 1 the 1 road, 1 they 1 hoped, 1 and 1 began 1 to 1 whisper 1 one 1 another\u2019s 1 names. 1 Ah! 1 it 1 was 1 worth 1 while; 1 it 1 was 1 the 1 great 1 joy 1 that 1 they 1 had 1 expected, 1 and 1 countless 1 little 1 joys 1 of 1 which 1 they 1 had 1 never 1 dreamt. 1 They 1 were 1 silent. 1 \u201cSignorino, 1 domani 1 faremo--\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 bother 1 that 1 man!\u201d 1 But 1 Lucy 1 remembered 1 the 1 vendor 1 of 1 photographs 1 and 1 said, 1 \u201cNo, 1 don\u2019t 1 be 1 rude 1 to 1 him.\u201d 1 Then 1 with 1 a 1 catching 1 of 1 her 1 breath, 1 she 1 murmured: 1 \u201cMr. 1 Eager 1 and 1 Charlotte, 1 dreadful 1 frozen 1 Charlotte. 1 How 1 cruel 1 she 1 would 1 be 1 to 1 a 1 man 1 like 1 that!\u201d 1 \u201cLook 1 at 1 the 1 lights 1 going 1 over 1 the 1 bridge.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 this 1 room 1 reminds 1 me 1 of 1 Charlotte. 1 How 1 horrible 1 to 1 grow 1 old 1 in 1 Charlotte\u2019s 1 way! 1 To 1 think 1 that 1 evening 1 at 1 the 1 rectory 1 that 1 she 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 have 1 heard 1 your 1 father 1 was 1 in 1 the 1 house. 1 For 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 stopped 1 me 1 going 1 in, 1 and 1 he 1 was 1 the 1 only 1 person 1 alive 1 who 1 could 1 have 1 made 1 me 1 see 1 sense. 1 You 1 couldn\u2019t 1 have 1 made 1 me. 1 When 1 I 1 am 1 very 1 happy\u201d--she 1 kissed 1 him--\u201cI 1 remember 1 on 1 how 1 little 1 it 1 all 1 hangs. 1 If 1 Charlotte 1 had 1 only 1 known, 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 stopped 1 me 1 going 1 in, 1 and 1 I 1 should 1 have 1 gone 1 to 1 silly 1 Greece, 1 and 1 become 1 different 1 for 1 ever.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 she 1 did 1 know,\u201d 1 said 1 George; 1 \u201cshe 1 did 1 see 1 my 1 father, 1 surely. 1 He 1 said 1 so.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 no, 1 she 1 didn\u2019t 1 see 1 him. 1 She 1 was 1 upstairs 1 with 1 old 1 Mrs. 1 Beebe, 1 don\u2019t 1 you 1 remember, 1 and 1 then 1 went 1 straight 1 to 1 the 1 church. 1 She 1 said 1 so.\u201d 1 George 1 was 1 obstinate 1 again. 1 \u201cMy 1 father,\u201d 1 said 1 he, 1 \u201csaw 1 her, 1 and 1 I 1 prefer 1 his 1 word. 1 He 1 was 1 dozing 1 by 1 the 1 study 1 fire, 1 and 1 he 1 opened 1 his 1 eyes, 1 and 1 there 1 was 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 A 1 few 1 minutes 1 before 1 you 1 came 1 in. 1 She 1 was 1 turning 1 to 1 go 1 as 1 he 1 woke 1 up. 1 He 1 didn\u2019t 1 speak 1 to 1 her.\u201d 1 Then 1 they 1 spoke 1 of 1 other 1 things--the 1 desultory 1 talk 1 of 1 those 1 who 1 have 1 been 1 fighting 1 to 1 reach 1 one 1 another, 1 and 1 whose 1 reward 1 is 1 to 1 rest 1 quietly 1 in 1 each 1 other\u2019s 1 arms. 1 It 1 was 1 long 1 ere 1 they 1 returned 1 to 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 but 1 when 1 they 1 did 1 her 1 behaviour 1 seemed 1 more 1 interesting. 1 George, 1 who 1 disliked 1 any 1 darkness, 1 said: 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 clear 1 that 1 she 1 knew. 1 Then, 1 why 1 did 1 she 1 risk 1 the 1 meeting? 1 She 1 knew 1 he 1 was 1 there, 1 and 1 yet 1 she 1 went 1 to 1 church.\u201d 1 They 1 tried 1 to 1 piece 1 the 1 thing 1 together. 1 As 1 they 1 talked, 1 an 1 incredible 1 solution 1 came 1 into 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 mind. 1 She 1 rejected 1 it, 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cHow 1 like 1 Charlotte 1 to 1 undo 1 her 1 work 1 by 1 a 1 feeble 1 muddle 1 at 1 the 1 last 1 moment.\u201d 1 But 1 something 1 in 1 the 1 dying 1 evening, 1 in 1 the 1 roar 1 of 1 the 1 river, 1 in 1 their 1 very 1 embrace 1 warned 1 them 1 that 1 her 1 words 1 fell 1 short 1 of 1 life, 1 and 1 George 1 whispered: 1 \u201cOr 1 did 1 she 1 mean 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cMean 1 what?\u201d 1 \u201cSignorino, 1 domani 1 faremo 1 uno 1 giro--\u201d 1 Lucy 1 bent 1 forward 1 and 1 said 1 with 1 gentleness: 1 \u201cLascia, 1 prego, 1 lascia. 1 Siamo 1 sposati.\u201d 1 \u201cScusi 1 tanto, 1 signora,\u201d 1 he 1 replied 1 in 1 tones 1 as 1 gentle 1 and 1 whipped 1 up 1 his 1 horse. 1 \u201cBuona 1 sera--e 1 grazie.\u201d 1 \u201cNiente.\u201d 1 The 1 cabman 1 drove 1 away 1 singing. 1 \u201cMean 1 what, 1 George?\u201d 1 He 1 whispered: 1 \u201cIs 1 it 1 this? 1 Is 1 this 1 possible? 1 I\u2019ll 1 put 1 a 1 marvel 1 to 1 you. 1 That 1 your 1 cousin 1 has 1 always 1 hoped. 1 That 1 from 1 the 1 very 1 first 1 moment 1 we 1 met, 1 she 1 hoped, 1 far 1 down 1 in 1 her 1 mind, 1 that 1 we 1 should 1 be 1 like 1 this--of 1 course, 1 very 1 far 1 down. 1 That 1 she 1 fought 1 us 1 on 1 the 1 surface, 1 and 1 yet 1 she 1 hoped. 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 explain 1 her 1 any 1 other 1 way. 1 Can 1 you? 1 Look 1 how 1 she 1 kept 1 me 1 alive 1 in 1 you 1 all 1 the 1 summer; 1 how 1 she 1 gave 1 you 1 no 1 peace; 1 how 1 month 1 after 1 month 1 she 1 became 1 more 1 eccentric 1 and 1 unreliable. 1 The 1 sight 1 of 1 us 1 haunted 1 her--or 1 she 1 couldn\u2019t 1 have 1 described 1 us 1 as 1 she 1 did 1 to 1 her 1 friend. 1 There 1 are 1 details--it 1 burnt. 1 I 1 read 1 the 1 book 1 afterwards. 1 She 1 is 1 not 1 frozen, 1 Lucy, 1 she 1 is 1 not 1 withered 1 up 1 all 1 through. 1 She 1 tore 1 us 1 apart 1 twice, 1 but 1 in 1 the 1 rectory 1 that 1 evening 1 she 1 was 1 given 1 one 1 more 1 chance 1 to 1 make 1 us 1 happy. 1 We 1 can 1 never 1 make 1 friends 1 with 1 her 1 or 1 thank 1 her. 1 But 1 I 1 do 1 believe 1 that, 1 far 1 down 1 in 1 her 1 heart, 1 far 1 below 1 all 1 speech 1 and 1 behaviour, 1 she 1 is 1 glad.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 impossible,\u201d 1 murmured 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 then, 1 remembering 1 the 1 experiences 1 of 1 her 1 own 1 heart, 1 she 1 said: 1 \u201cNo--it 1 is 1 just 1 possible.\u201d 1 Youth 1 enwrapped 1 them; 1 the 1 song 1 of 1 Phaethon 1 announced 1 passion 1 requited, 1 love 1 attained. 1 But 1 they 1 were 1 conscious 1 of 1 a 1 love 1 more 1 mysterious 1 than 1 this. 1 The 1 song 1 died 1 away; 1 they 1 heard 1 the 1 river, 1 bearing 1 down 1 the 1 snows 1 of 1 winter 1 into 1 the 1 Mediterranean. 1 End 1 of 1 the 1 Project 1 Gutenberg 1 EBook 1 of 1 A 1

Otway--a 1 Radical 1 if 1 ever 1 there 1 was?\u201d 1 \u201cVery 1 well 1 indeed.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 old 1 Mrs. 1 Butterworth 1 the 1 philanthropist?\u201d 1 \u201cWhy, 1 she 1 rents 1 a 1 field 1 of 1 us! 1 How 1 funny!\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 looked 1 at 1 the 1 narrow 1 ribbon 1 of 1 sky, 1 and 1 murmured: 1 \u201cOh, 1 you 1 have 1 property 1 in 1 Surrey?\u201d 1 \u201cHardly 1 any,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 fearful 1 of 1 being 1 thought 1 a 1 snob. 1 \u201cOnly 1 thirty 1 acres--just 1 the 1 garden, 1 all 1 downhill, 1 and 1 some 1 fields.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 was 1 not 1 disgusted, 1 and 1 said 1 it 1 was 1 just 1 the 1 size 1 of 1 her 1 aunt\u2019s 1 Suffolk 1 estate. 1 Italy 1 receded. 1 They 1 tried 1 to 1 remember 1 the 1 last 1 name 1 of 1 Lady 1 Louisa 1 someone, 1 who 1 had 1 taken 1 a 1 house 1 near 1 Summer 1 Street 1 the 1 other 1 year, 1 but 1 she 1 had 1 not 1 liked 1 it, 1 which 1 was 1 odd 1 of 1 her. 1 And 1 just 1 as 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 got 1 the 1 name, 1 she 1 broke 1 off 1 and 1 exclaimed: 1 \u201cBless 1 us! 1 Bless 1 us 1 and 1 save 1 us! 1 We\u2019ve 1 lost 1 the 1 way.\u201d 1 Certainly 1 they 1 had 1 seemed 1 a 1 long 1 time 1 in 1 reaching 1 Santa 1 Croce, 1 the 1 tower 1 of 1 which 1 had 1 been 1 plainly 1 visible 1 from 1 the 1 landing 1 window. 1 But 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 said 1 so 1 much 1 about 1 knowing 1 her 1 Florence 1 by 1 heart, 1 that 1 Lucy 1 had 1 followed 1 her 1 with 1 no 1 misgivings. 1 \u201cLost! 1 lost! 1 My 1 dear 1 Miss 1 Lucy, 1 during 1 our 1 political 1 diatribes 1 we 1 have 1 taken 1 a 1 wrong 1 turning. 1 How 1 those 1 horrid 1 Conservatives 1 would 1 jeer 1 at 1 us! 1 What 1 are 1 we 1 to 1 do? 1 Two 1 lone 1 females 1 in 1 an 1 unknown 1 town. 1 Now, 1 this 1 is 1 what 1 I 1 call 1 an 1 adventure.\u201d 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 wanted 1 to 1 see 1 Santa 1 Croce, 1 suggested, 1 as 1 a 1 possible 1 solution, 1 that 1 they 1 should 1 ask 1 the 1 way 1 there. 1 \u201cOh, 1 but 1 that 1 is 1 the 1 word 1 of 1 a 1 craven! 1 And 1 no, 1 you 1 are 1 not, 1 not, 1 NOT 1 to 1 look 1 at 1 your 1 Baedeker. 1 Give 1 it 1 to 1 me; 1 I 1 shan\u2019t 1 let 1 you 1 carry 1 it. 1 We 1 will 1 simply 1 drift.\u201d 1 Accordingly 1 they 1 drifted 1 through 1 a 1 series 1 of 1 those 1 grey-brown 1 streets, 1 neither 1 commodious 1 nor 1 picturesque, 1 in 1 which 1 the 1 eastern 1 quarter 1 of 1 the 1 city 1 abounds. 1 Lucy 1 soon 1 lost 1 interest 1 in 1 the 1 discontent 1 of 1 Lady 1 Louisa, 1 and 1 became 1 discontented 1 herself. 1 For 1 one 1 ravishing 1 moment 1 Italy 1 appeared. 1 She 1 stood 1 in 1 the 1 Square 1 of 1 the 1 Annunziata 1 and 1 saw 1 in 1 the 1 living 1 terra-cotta 1 those 1 divine 1 babies 1 whom 1 no 1 cheap 1 reproduction 1 can 1 ever 1 stale. 1 There 1 they 1 stood, 1 with 1 their 1 shining 1 limbs 1 bursting 1 from 1 the 1 garments 1 of 1 charity, 1 and 1 their 1 strong 1 white 1 arms 1 extended 1 against 1 circlets 1 of 1 heaven. 1 Lucy 1 thought 1 she 1 had 1 never 1 seen 1 anything 1 more 1 beautiful; 1 but 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 with 1 a 1 shriek 1 of 1 dismay, 1 dragged 1 her 1 forward, 1 declaring 1 that 1 they 1 were 1 out 1 of 1 their 1 path 1 now 1 by 1 at 1 least 1 a 1 mile. 1 The 1 hour 1 was 1 approaching 1 at 1 which 1 the 1 continental 1 breakfast 1 begins, 1 or 1 rather 1 ceases, 1 to 1 tell, 1 and 1 the 1 ladies 1 bought 1 some 1 hot 1 chestnut 1 paste 1 out 1 of 1 a 1 little 1 shop, 1 because 1 it 1 looked 1 so 1 typical. 1 It 1 tasted 1 partly 1 of 1 the 1 paper 1 in 1 which 1 it 1 was 1 wrapped, 1 partly 1 of 1 hair 1 oil, 1 partly 1 of 1 the 1 great 1 unknown. 1 But 1 it 1 gave 1 them 1 strength 1 to 1 drift 1 into 1 another 1 Piazza, 1 large 1 and 1 dusty, 1 on 1 the 1 farther 1 side 1 of 1 which 1 rose 1 a 1 black-and-white 1 facade 1 of 1 surpassing 1 ugliness. 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 spoke 1 to 1 it 1 dramatically. 1 It 1 was 1 Santa 1 Croce. 1 The 1 adventure 1 was 1 over. 1 \u201cStop 1 a 1 minute; 1 let 1 those 1 two 1 people 1 go 1 on, 1 or 1 I 1 shall 1 have 1 to 1 speak 1 to 1 them. 1 I 1 do 1 detest 1 conventional 1 intercourse. 1 Nasty! 1 they 1 are 1 going 1 into 1 the 1 church, 1 too. 1 Oh, 1 the 1 Britisher 1 abroad!\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 sat 1 opposite 1 them 1 at 1 dinner 1 last 1 night. 1 They 1 have 1 given 1 us 1 their 1 rooms. 1 They 1 were 1 so 1 very 1 kind.\u201d 1 \u201cLook 1 at 1 their 1 figures!\u201d 1 laughed 1 Miss 1 Lavish. 1 \u201cThey 1 walk 1 through 1 my 1 Italy 1 like 1 a 1 pair 1 of 1 cows. 1 It\u2019s 1 very 1 naughty 1 of 1 me, 1 but 1 I 1 would 1 like 1 to 1 set 1 an 1 examination 1 paper 1 at 1 Dover, 1 and 1 turn 1 back 1 every 1 tourist 1 who 1 couldn\u2019t 1 pass 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 would 1 you 1 ask 1 us?\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 laid 1 her 1 hand 1 pleasantly 1 on 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 arm, 1 as 1 if 1 to 1 suggest 1 that 1 she, 1 at 1 all 1 events, 1 would 1 get 1 full 1 marks. 1 In 1 this 1 exalted 1 mood 1 they 1 reached 1 the 1 steps 1 of 1 the 1 great 1 church, 1 and 1 were 1 about 1 to 1 enter 1 it 1 when 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 stopped, 1 squeaked, 1 flung 1 up 1 her 1 arms, 1 and 1 cried: 1 \u201cThere 1 goes 1 my 1 local-colour 1 box! 1 I 1 must 1 have 1 a 1 word 1 with 1 him!\u201d 1 And 1 in 1 a 1 moment 1 she 1 was 1 away 1 over 1 the 1 Piazza, 1 her 1 military 1 cloak 1 flapping 1 in 1 the 1 wind; 1 nor 1 did 1 she 1 slacken 1 speed 1 till 1 she 1 caught 1 up 1 an 1 old 1 man 1 with 1 white 1 whiskers, 1 and 1 nipped 1 him 1 playfully 1 upon 1 the 1 arm. 1 Lucy 1 waited 1 for 1 nearly 1 ten 1 minutes. 1 Then 1 she 1 began 1 to 1 get 1 tired. 1 The 1 beggars 1 worried 1 her, 1 the 1 dust 1 blew 1 in 1 her 1 eyes, 1 and 1 she 1 remembered 1 that 1 a 1 young 1 girl 1 ought 1 not 1 to 1 loiter 1 in 1 public 1 places. 1 She 1 descended 1 slowly 1 into 1 the 1 Piazza 1 with 1 the 1 intention 1 of 1 rejoining 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 who 1 was 1 really 1 almost 1 too 1 original. 1 But 1 at 1 that 1 moment 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 and 1 her 1 local-colour 1 box 1 moved 1 also, 1 and 1 disappeared 1 down 1 a 1 side 1 street, 1 both 1 gesticulating 1 largely. 1 Tears 1 of 1 indignation 1 came 1 to 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 eyes 1 partly 1 because 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 jilted 1 her, 1 partly 1 because 1 she 1 had 1 taken 1 her 1 Baedeker. 1 How 1 could 1 she 1 find 1 her 1 way 1 home? 1 How 1 could 1 she 1 find 1 her 1 way 1 about 1 in 1 Santa 1 Croce? 1 Her 1 first 1 morning 1 was 1 ruined, 1 and 1 she 1 might 1 never 1 be 1 in 1 Florence 1 again. 1 A 1 few 1 minutes 1 ago 1 she 1 had 1 been 1 all 1 high 1 spirits, 1 talking 1 as 1 a 1 woman 1 of 1 culture, 1 and 1 half 1 persuading 1 herself 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 full 1 of 1 originality. 1 Now 1 she 1 entered 1 the 1 church 1 depressed 1 and 1 humiliated, 1 not 1 even 1 able 1 to 1 remember 1 whether 1 it 1 was 1 built 1 by 1 the 1 Franciscans 1 or 1 the 1 Dominicans. 1 Of 1 course, 1 it 1 must 1 be 1 a 1 wonderful 1 building. 1 But 1 how 1 like 1 a 1 barn! 1 And 1 how 1 very 1 cold! 1 Of 1 course, 1 it 1 contained 1 frescoes 1 by 1 Giotto, 1 in 1 the 1 presence 1 of 1 whose 1 tactile 1 values 1 she 1 was 1 capable 1 of 1 feeling 1 what 1 was 1 proper. 1 But 1 who 1 was 1 to 1 tell 1 her 1 which 1 they 1 were? 1 She 1 walked 1 about 1 disdainfully, 1 unwilling 1 to 1 be 1 enthusiastic 1 over 1 monuments 1 of 1 uncertain 1 authorship 1 or 1 date. 1 There 1 was 1 no 1 one 1 even 1 to 1 tell 1 her 1 which, 1 of 1 all 1 the 1 sepulchral 1 slabs 1 that 1 paved 1 the 1 nave 1 and 1 transepts, 1 was 1 the 1 one 1 that 1 was 1 really 1 beautiful, 1 the 1 one 1 that 1 had 1 been 1 most 1 praised 1 by 1 Mr. 1 Ruskin. 1 Then 1 the 1 pernicious 1 charm 1 of 1 Italy 1 worked 1 on 1 her, 1 and, 1 instead 1 of 1 acquiring 1 information, 1 she 1 began 1 to 1 be 1 happy. 1 She 1 puzzled 1 out 1 the 1 Italian 1 notices--the 1 notices 1 that 1 forbade 1 people 1 to 1 introduce 1 dogs 1 into 1 the 1 church--the 1 notice 1 that 1 prayed 1 people, 1 in 1 the 1 interest 1 of 1 health 1 and 1 out 1 of 1 respect 1 to 1 the 1 sacred 1 edifice 1 in 1 which 1 they 1 found 1 themselves, 1 not 1 to 1 spit. 1 She 1 watched 1 the 1 tourists; 1 their 1 noses 1 were 1 as 1 red 1 as 1 their 1 Baedekers, 1 so 1 cold 1 was 1 Santa 1 Croce. 1 She 1 beheld 1 the 1 horrible 1 fate 1 that 1 overtook 1 three 1 Papists--two 1 he-babies 1 and 1 a 1 she-baby--who 1 began 1 their 1 career 1 by 1 sousing 1 each 1 other 1 with 1 the 1 Holy 1 Water, 1 and 1 then 1 proceeded 1 to 1 the 1 Machiavelli 1 memorial, 1 dripping 1 but 1 hallowed. 1 Advancing 1 towards 1 it 1 very 1 slowly 1 and 1 from 1 immense 1 distances, 1 they 1 touched 1 the 1 stone 1 with 1 their 1 fingers, 1 with 1 their 1 handkerchiefs, 1 with 1 their 1 heads, 1 and 1 then 1 retreated. 1 What 1 could 1 this 1 mean? 1 They 1 did 1 it 1 again 1 and 1 again. 1 Then 1 Lucy 1 realized 1 that 1 they 1 had 1 mistaken 1 Machiavelli 1 for 1 some 1 saint, 1 hoping 1 to 1 acquire 1 virtue. 1 Punishment 1 followed 1 quickly. 1 The 1 smallest 1 he-baby 1 stumbled 1 over 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 sepulchral 1 slabs 1 so 1 much 1 admired 1 by 1 Mr. 1 Ruskin, 1 and 1 entangled 1 his 1 feet 1 in 1 the 1 features 1 of 1 a 1 recumbent 1 bishop. 1 Protestant 1 as 1 she 1 was, 1 Lucy 1 darted 1 forward. 1 She 1 was 1 too 1 late. 1 He 1 fell 1 heavily 1 upon 1 the 1 prelate\u2019s 1 upturned 1 toes. 1 \u201cHateful 1 bishop!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 the 1 voice 1 of 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 who 1 had 1 darted 1 forward 1 also. 1 \u201cHard 1 in 1 life, 1 hard 1 in 1 death. 1 Go 1 out 1 into 1 the 1 sunshine, 1 little 1 boy, 1 and 1 kiss 1 your 1 hand 1 to 1 the 1 sun, 1 for 1 that 1 is 1 where 1 you 1 ought 1 to 1 be. 1 Intolerable 1 bishop!\u201d 1 The 1 child 1 screamed 1 frantically 1 at 1 these 1 words, 1 and 1 at 1 these 1 dreadful 1 people 1 who 1 picked 1 him 1 up, 1 dusted 1 him, 1 rubbed 1 his 1 bruises, 1 and 1 told 1 him 1 not 1 to 1 be 1 superstitious. 1 \u201cLook 1 at 1 him!\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 to 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cHere\u2019s 1 a 1 mess: 1 a 1 baby 1 hurt, 1 cold, 1 and 1 frightened! 1 But 1 what 1 else 1 can 1 you 1 expect 1 from 1 a 1 church?\u201d 1 The 1 child\u2019s 1 legs 1 had 1 become 1 as 1 melting 1 wax. 1 Each 1 time 1 that 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 and 1 Lucy 1 set 1 it 1 erect 1 it 1 collapsed 1 with 1 a 1 roar. 1 Fortunately 1 an 1 Italian 1 lady, 1 who 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 been 1 saying 1 her 1 prayers, 1 came 1 to 1 the 1 rescue. 1 By 1 some 1 mysterious 1 virtue, 1 which 1 mothers 1 alone 1 possess, 1 she 1 stiffened 1 the 1 little 1 boy\u2019s 1 back-bone 1 and 1 imparted 1 strength 1 to 1 his 1 knees. 1 He 1 stood. 1 Still 1 gibbering 1 with 1 agitation, 1 he 1 walked 1 away. 1 \u201cYou 1 are 1 a 1 clever 1 woman,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 \u201cYou 1 have 1 done 1 more 1 than 1 all 1 the 1 relics 1 in 1 the 1 world. 1 I 1 am 1 not 1 of 1 your 1 creed, 1 but 1 I 1 do 1 believe 1 in 1 those 1 who 1 make 1 their 1 fellow-creatures 1 happy. 1 There 1 is 1 no 1 scheme 1 of 1 the 1 universe--\u201d 1 He 1 paused 1 for 1 a 1 phrase. 1 \u201cNiente,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 Italian 1 lady, 1 and 1 returned 1 to 1 her 1 prayers. 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 not 1 sure 1 she 1 understands 1 English,\u201d 1 suggested 1 Lucy. 1 In 1 her 1 chastened 1 mood 1 she 1 no 1 longer 1 despised 1 the 1 Emersons. 1 She 1 was 1 determined 1 to 1 be 1 gracious 1 to 1 them, 1 beautiful 1 rather 1 than 1 delicate, 1 and, 1 if 1 possible, 1 to 1 erase 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 civility 1 by 1 some 1 gracious 1 reference 1 to 1 the 1 pleasant 1 rooms. 1 \u201cThat 1 woman 1 understands 1 everything,\u201d 1 was 1 Mr. 1 Emerson\u2019s 1 reply. 1 \u201cBut 1 what 1 are 1 you 1 doing 1 here? 1 Are 1 you 1 doing 1 the 1 church? 1 Are 1 you 1 through 1 with 1 the 1 church?\u201d 1 \u201cNo,\u201d 1 cried 1 Lucy, 1 remembering 1 her 1 grievance. 1 \u201cI 1 came 1 here 1 with 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 who 1 was 1 to 1 explain 1 everything; 1 and 1 just 1 by 1 the 1 door--it 1 is 1 too 1 bad!--she 1 simply 1 ran 1 away, 1 and 1 after 1 waiting 1 quite 1 a 1 time, 1 I 1 had 1 to 1 come 1 in 1 by 1 myself.\u201d 1 \u201cWhy 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 you?\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 \u201cYes, 1 why 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 you 1 come 1 by 1 yourself?\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 son, 1 addressing 1 the 1 young 1 lady 1 for 1 the 1 first 1 time. 1 \u201cBut 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 has 1 even 1 taken 1 away 1 Baedeker.\u201d 1 \u201cBaedeker?\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 glad 1 it\u2019s 1 THAT 1 you 1 minded. 1 It\u2019s 1 worth 1 minding, 1 the 1 loss 1 of 1 a 1 Baedeker. 1 THAT\u2019S 1 worth 1 minding.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 was 1 puzzled. 1 She 1 was 1 again 1 conscious 1 of 1 some 1 new 1 idea, 1 and 1 was 1 not 1 sure 1 whither 1 it 1 would 1 lead 1 her. 1 \u201cIf 1 you\u2019ve 1 no 1 Baedeker,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 son, 1 \u201cyou\u2019d 1 better 1 join 1 us.\u201d 1 Was 1 this 1 where 1 the 1 idea 1 would 1 lead? 1 She 1 took 1 refuge 1 in 1 her 1 dignity. 1 \u201cThank 1 you 1 very 1 much, 1 but 1 I 1 could 1 not 1 think 1 of 1 that. 1 I 1 hope 1 you 1 do 1 not 1 suppose 1 that 1 I 1 came 1 to 1 join 1 on 1 to 1 you. 1 I 1 really 1 came 1 to 1 help 1 with 1 the 1 child, 1 and 1 to 1 thank 1 you 1 for 1 so 1 kindly 1 giving 1 us 1 your 1 rooms 1 last 1 night. 1 I 1 hope 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 not 1 been 1 put 1 to 1 any 1 great 1 inconvenience.\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 dear,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 old 1 man 1 gently, 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 repeating 1 what 1 you 1 have 1 heard 1 older 1 people 1 say. 1 You 1 are 1 pretending 1 to 1 be 1 touchy; 1 but 1 you 1 are 1 not 1 really. 1 Stop 1 being 1 so 1 tiresome, 1 and 1 tell 1 me 1 carriage. 1 And, 1 in 1 any 1 case, 1 we 1 are 1 infinitely 1 safer 1 than 1 if 1 we 1 were 1 walking. 1 Courage--courage 1 and 1 faith.\u201d 1 Under 1 the 1 rug, 1 Lucy 1 felt 1 the 1 kindly 1 pressure 1 of 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 hand. 1 At 1 times 1 our 1 need 1 for 1 a 1 sympathetic 1 gesture 1 is 1 so 1 great 1 that 1 we 1 care 1 not 1 what 1 exactly 1 it 1 signifies 1 or 1 how 1 much 1 we 1 may 1 have 1 to 1 pay 1 for 1 it 1 afterwards. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 by 1 this 1 timely 1 exercise 1 of 1 her 1 muscles, 1 gained 1 more 1 than 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 got 1 in 1 hours 1 of 1 preaching 1 or 1 cross 1 examination. 1 She 1 renewed 1 it 1 when 1 the 1 two 1 carriages 1 stopped, 1 half 1 into 1 Florence. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Eager!\u201d 1 called 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cWe 1 want 1 your 1 assistance. 1 Will 1 you 1 interpret 1 for 1 us?\u201d 1 \u201cGeorge!\u201d 1 cried 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 \u201cAsk 1 your 1 driver 1 which 1 way 1 George 1 went. 1 The 1 boy 1 may 1 lose 1 his 1 way. 1 He 1 may 1 be 1 killed.\u201d 1 \u201cGo, 1 Mr. 1 Eager,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 \u201cdon\u2019t 1 ask 1 our 1 driver; 1 our 1 driver 1 is 1 no 1 help. 1 Go 1 and 1 support 1 poor 1 Mr. 1 Beebe--, 1 he 1 is 1 nearly 1 demented.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 may 1 be 1 killed!\u201d 1 cried 1 the 1 old 1 man. 1 \u201cHe 1 may 1 be 1 killed!\u201d 1 \u201cTypical 1 behaviour,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 chaplain, 1 as 1 he 1 quitted 1 the 1 carriage. 1 \u201cIn 1 the 1 presence 1 of 1 reality 1 that 1 kind 1 of 1 person 1 invariably 1 breaks 1 down.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 does 1 he 1 know?\u201d 1 whispered 1 Lucy 1 as 1 soon 1 as 1 they 1 were 1 alone. 1 \u201cCharlotte, 1 how 1 much 1 does 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 know?\u201d 1 \u201cNothing, 1 dearest; 1 he 1 knows 1 nothing. 1 But--\u201d 1 she 1 pointed 1 at 1 the 1 driver-\u201cHE 1 knows 1 everything. 1 Dearest, 1 had 1 we 1 better? 1 Shall 1 I?\u201d 1 She 1 took 1 out 1 her 1 purse. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 dreadful 1 to 1 be 1 entangled 1 with 1 low-class 1 people. 1 He 1 saw 1 it 1 all.\u201d 1 Tapping 1 Phaethon\u2019s 1 back 1 with 1 her 1 guide-book, 1 she 1 said, 1 \u201cSilenzio!\u201d 1 and 1 offered 1 him 1 a 1 franc. 1 \u201cVa 1 bene,\u201d 1 he 1 replied, 1 and 1 accepted 1 it. 1 As 1 well 1 this 1 ending 1 to 1 his 1 day 1 as 1 any. 1 But 1 Lucy, 1 a 1 mortal 1 maid, 1 was 1 disappointed 1 in 1 him. 1 There 1 was 1 an 1 explosion 1 up 1 the 1 road. 1 The 1 storm 1 had 1 struck 1 the 1 overhead 1 wire 1 of 1 the 1 tramline, 1 and 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 great 1 supports 1 had 1 fallen. 1 If 1 they 1 had 1 not 1 stopped 1 perhaps 1 they 1 might 1 have 1 been 1 hurt. 1 They 1 chose 1 to 1 regard 1 it 1 as 1 a 1 miraculous 1 preservation, 1 and 1 the 1 floods 1 of 1 love 1 and 1 sincerity, 1 which 1 fructify 1 every 1 hour 1 of 1 life, 1 burst 1 forth 1 in 1 tumult. 1 They 1 descended 1 from 1 the 1 carriages; 1 they 1 embraced 1 each 1 other. 1 It 1 was 1 as 1 joyful 1 to 1 be 1 forgiven 1 past 1 unworthinesses 1 as 1 to 1 forgive 1 them. 1 For 1 a 1 moment 1 they 1 realized 1 vast 1 possibilities 1 of 1 good. 1 The 1 older 1 people 1 recovered 1 quickly. 1 In 1 the 1 very 1 height 1 of 1 their 1 emotion 1 they 1 knew 1 it 1 to 1 be 1 unmanly 1 or 1 unladylike. 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 calculated 1 that, 1 even 1 if 1 they 1 had 1 continued, 1 they 1 would 1 not 1 have 1 been 1 caught 1 in 1 the 1 accident. 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 mumbled 1 a 1 temperate 1 prayer. 1 But 1 the 1 drivers, 1 through 1 miles 1 of 1 dark 1 squalid 1 road, 1 poured 1 out 1 their 1 souls 1 to 1 the 1 dryads 1 and 1 the 1 saints, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 poured 1 out 1 hers 1 to 1 her 1 cousin. 1 \u201cCharlotte, 1 dear 1 Charlotte, 1 kiss 1 me. 1 Kiss 1 me 1 again. 1 Only 1 you 1 can 1 understand 1 me. 1 You 1 warned 1 me 1 to 1 be 1 careful. 1 And 1 I--I 1 thought 1 I 1 was 1 developing.\u201d 1 \u201cDo 1 not 1 cry, 1 dearest. 1 Take 1 your 1 time.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 been 1 obstinate 1 and 1 silly--worse 1 than 1 you 1 know, 1 far 1 worse. 1 Once 1 by 1 the 1 river--Oh, 1 but 1 he 1 isn\u2019t 1 killed--he 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 be 1 killed, 1 would 1 he?\u201d 1 The 1 thought 1 disturbed 1 her 1 repentance. 1 As 1 a 1 matter 1 of 1 fact, 1 the 1 storm 1 was 1 worst 1 along 1 the 1 road; 1 but 1 she 1 had 1 been 1 near 1 danger, 1 and 1 so 1 she 1 thought 1 it 1 must 1 be 1 near 1 to 1 everyone. 1 \u201cI 1 trust 1 not. 1 One 1 would 1 always 1 pray 1 against 1 that.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 really--I 1 think 1 he 1 was 1 taken 1 by 1 surprise, 1 just 1 as 1 I 1 was 1 before. 1 But 1 this 1 time 1 I\u2019m 1 not 1 to 1 blame; 1 I 1 want 1 you 1 to 1 believe 1 that. 1 I 1 simply 1 slipped 1 into 1 those 1 violets. 1 No, 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 be 1 really 1 truthful. 1 I 1 am 1 a 1 little 1 to 1 blame. 1 I 1 had 1 silly 1 thoughts. 1 The 1 sky, 1 you 1 know, 1 was 1 gold, 1 and 1 the 1 ground 1 all 1 blue, 1 and 1 for 1 a 1 moment 1 he 1 looked 1 like 1 someone 1 in 1 a 1 book.\u201d 1 \u201cIn 1 a 1 book?\u201d 1 \u201cHeroes--gods--the 1 nonsense 1 of 1 schoolgirls.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 then?\u201d 1 \u201cBut, 1 Charlotte, 1 you 1 know 1 what 1 happened 1 then.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 silent. 1 Indeed, 1 she 1 had 1 little 1 more 1 to 1 learn. 1 With 1 a 1 certain 1 amount 1 of 1 insight 1 she 1 drew 1 her 1 young 1 cousin 1 affectionately 1 to 1 her. 1 All 1 the 1 way 1 back 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 body 1 was 1 shaken 1 by 1 deep 1 sighs, 1 which 1 nothing 1 could 1 repress. 1 \u201cI 1 want 1 to 1 be 1 truthful,\u201d 1 she 1 whispered. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 so 1 hard 1 to 1 be 1 absolutely 1 truthful.\u201d 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 be 1 troubled, 1 dearest. 1 Wait 1 till 1 you 1 are 1 calmer. 1 We 1 will 1 talk 1 it 1 over 1 before 1 bed-time 1 in 1 my 1 room.\u201d 1 So 1 they 1 re-entered 1 the 1 city 1 with 1 hands 1 clasped. 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 shock 1 to 1 the 1 girl 1 to 1 find 1 how 1 far 1 emotion 1 had 1 ebbed 1 in 1 others. 1 The 1 storm 1 had 1 ceased, 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 easier 1 about 1 his 1 son. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 had 1 regained 1 good 1 humour, 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 was 1 already 1 snubbing 1 Miss 1 Lavish. 1 Charlotte 1 alone 1 she 1 was 1 sure 1 of--Charlotte, 1 whose 1 exterior 1 concealed 1 so 1 much 1 insight 1 and 1 love. 1 The 1 luxury 1 of 1 self-exposure 1 kept 1 her 1 almost 1 happy 1 through 1 the 1 long 1 evening. 1 She 1 thought 1 not 1 so 1 much 1 of 1 what 1 had 1 happened 1 as 1 of 1 how 1 she 1 should 1 describe 1 it. 1 All 1 her 1 sensations, 1 her 1 spasms 1 of 1 courage, 1 her 1 moments 1 of 1 unreasonable 1 joy, 1 her 1 mysterious 1 discontent, 1 should 1 be 1 carefully 1 laid 1 before 1 her 1 cousin. 1 And 1 together 1 in 1 divine 1 confidence 1 they 1 would 1 disentangle 1 and 1 interpret 1 them 1 all. 1 \u201cAt 1 last,\u201d 1 thought 1 she, 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 understand 1 myself. 1 I 1 shan\u2019t 1 again 1 be 1 troubled 1 by 1 things 1 that 1 come 1 out 1 of 1 nothing, 1 and 1 mean 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 what.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Alan 1 asked 1 her 1 to 1 play. 1 She 1 refused 1 vehemently. 1 Music 1 seemed 1 to 1 her 1 the 1 employment 1 of 1 a 1 child. 1 She 1 sat 1 close 1 to 1 her 1 cousin, 1 who, 1 with 1 commendable 1 patience, 1 was 1 listening 1 to 1 a 1 long 1 story 1 about 1 lost 1 luggage. 1 When 1 it 1 was 1 over 1 she 1 capped 1 it 1 by 1 a 1 story 1 of 1 her 1 own. 1 Lucy 1 became 1 rather 1 hysterical 1 with 1 the 1 delay. 1 In 1 vain 1 she 1 tried 1 to 1 check, 1 or 1 at 1 all 1 events 1 to 1 accelerate, 1 the 1 tale. 1 It 1 was 1 not 1 till 1 a 1 late 1 hour 1 that 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 recovered 1 her 1 luggage 1 and 1 could 1 say 1 in 1 her 1 usual 1 tone 1 of 1 gentle 1 reproach: 1 \u201cWell, 1 dear, 1 I 1 at 1 all 1 events 1 am 1 ready 1 for 1 Bedfordshire. 1 Come 1 into 1 my 1 room, 1 and 1 I 1 will 1 give 1 a 1 good 1 brush 1 to 1 your 1 hair.\u201d 1 With 1 some 1 solemnity 1 the 1 door 1 was 1 shut, 1 and 1 a 1 cane 1 chair 1 placed 1 for 1 the 1 girl. 1 Then 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 said 1 \u201cSo 1 what 1 is 1 to 1 be 1 done?\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 unprepared 1 for 1 the 1 question. 1 It 1 had 1 not 1 occurred 1 to 1 her 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 to 1 do 1 anything. 1 A 1 detailed 1 exhibition 1 of 1 her 1 emotions 1 was 1 all 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 counted 1 upon. 1 \u201cWhat 1 is 1 to 1 be 1 done? 1 A 1 point, 1 dearest, 1 which 1 you 1 alone 1 can 1 settle.\u201d 1 The 1 rain 1 was 1 streaming 1 down 1 the 1 black 1 windows, 1 and 1 the 1 great 1 room 1 felt 1 damp 1 and 1 chilly, 1 One 1 candle 1 burnt 1 trembling 1 on 1 the 1 chest 1 of 1 drawers 1 close 1 to 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 toque, 1 which 1 cast 1 monstrous 1 and 1 fantastic 1 shadows 1 on 1 the 1 bolted 1 door. 1 A 1 tram 1 roared 1 by 1 in 1 the 1 dark, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 felt 1 unaccountably 1 sad, 1 though 1 she 1 had 1 long 1 since 1 dried 1 her 1 eyes. 1 She 1 lifted 1 them 1 to 1 the 1 ceiling, 1 where 1 the 1 griffins 1 and 1 bassoons 1 were 1 colourless 1 and 1 vague, 1 the 1 very 1 ghosts 1 of 1 joy. 1 \u201cIt 1 has 1 been 1 raining 1 for 1 nearly 1 four 1 hours,\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 at 1 last. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 ignored 1 the 1 remark. 1 \u201cHow 1 do 1 you 1 propose 1 to 1 silence 1 him?\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 driver?\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 dear 1 girl, 1 no; 1 Mr. 1 George 1 Emerson.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 began 1 to 1 pace 1 up 1 and 1 down 1 the 1 room. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 understand,\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 at 1 last. 1 She 1 understood 1 very 1 well, 1 but 1 she 1 no 1 longer 1 wished 1 to 1 be 1 absolutely 1 truthful. 1 \u201cHow 1 are 1 you 1 going 1 to 1 stop 1 him 1 talking 1 about 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 a 1 feeling 1 that 1 talk 1 is 1 a 1 thing 1 he 1 will 1 never 1 do.\u201d 1 \u201cI, 1 too, 1 intend 1 to 1 judge 1 him 1 charitably. 1 But 1 unfortunately 1 I 1 have 1 met 1 the 1 type 1 before. 1 They 1 seldom 1 keep 1 their 1 exploits 1 to 1 themselves.\u201d 1 \u201cExploits?\u201d 1 cried 1 Lucy, 1 wincing 1 under 1 the 1 horrible 1 plural. 1 \u201cMy 1 poor 1 dear, 1 did 1 you 1 suppose 1 that 1 this 1 was 1 his 1 first? 1 Come 1 here 1 and 1 listen 1 to 1 me. 1 I 1 am 1 only 1 gathering 1 it 1 from 1 his 1 own 1 remarks. 1 Do 1 you 1 remember 1 that 1 day 1 at 1 lunch 1 when 1 he 1 argued 1 with 1 Miss 1 Alan 1 that 1 liking 1 one 1 person 1 is 1 an 1 extra 1 reason 1 for 1 liking 1 another?\u201d 1 \u201cYes,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 whom 1 at 1 the 1 time 1 the 1 argument 1 had 1 pleased. 1 \u201cWell, 1 I 1 am 1 no 1 prude. 1 There 1 is 1 no 1 need 1 to 1 call 1 him 1 a 1 wicked 1 young 1 man, 1 but 1 obviously 1 he 1 is 1 thoroughly 1 unrefined. 1 Let 1 us 1 put 1 it 1 down 1 to 1 his 1 deplorable 1 antecedents 1 and 1 education, 1 if 1 you 1 wish. 1 But 1 we 1 are 1 no 1 farther 1 on 1 with 1 our 1 question. 1 What 1 do 1 you 1 propose 1 to 1 do?\u201d 1 An 1 idea 1 rushed 1 across 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 brain, 1 which, 1 had 1 she 1 thought 1 of 1 it 1 sooner 1 and 1 made 1 it 1 part 1 of 1 her, 1 might 1 have 1 proved 1 victorious. 1 \u201cI 1 propose 1 to 1 speak 1 to 1 him,\u201d 1 said 1 she. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 uttered 1 a 1 cry 1 of 1 genuine 1 alarm. 1 \u201cYou 1 see, 1 Charlotte, 1 your 1 kindness--I 1 shall 1 never 1 forget 1 it. 1 But--as 1 you 1 said--it 1 is 1 my 1 affair. 1 Mine 1 and 1 his.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 you 1 are 1 going 1 to 1 IMPLORE 1 him, 1 to 1 BEG 1 him 1 to 1 keep 1 silence?\u201d 1 \u201cCertainly 1 not. 1 There 1 would 1 be 1 no 1 difficulty. 1 Whatever 1 you 1 ask 1 him 1 he 1 answers, 1 yes 1 or 1 no; 1 then 1 it 1 is 1 over. 1 I 1 have 1 been 1 frightened 1 of 1 him. 1 But 1 now 1 I 1 am 1 not 1 one 1 little 1 bit.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 we 1 fear 1 him 1 for 1 you, 1 dear. 1 You 1 are 1 so 1 young 1 and 1 inexperienced, 1 you 1 have 1 lived 1 among 1 such 1 nice 1 people, 1 that 1 you 1 cannot 1 realize 1 what 1 men 1 can 1 be--how 1 they 1 can 1 take 1 a 1 brutal 1 pleasure 1 in 1 insulting 1 a 1 woman 1 whom 1 her 1 sex 1 does 1 not 1 protect 1 and 1 rally 1 round. 1 This 1 afternoon, 1 for 1 example, 1 if 1 I 1 had 1 not 1 arrived, 1 what 1 would 1 have 1 happened?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 think,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 gravely. 1 Something 1 in 1 her 1 voice 1 made 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 repeat 1 her 1 question, 1 intoning 1 it 1 more 1 vigorously. 1 \u201cWhat 1 would 1 have 1 happened 1 if 1 I 1 hadn\u2019t 1 arrived?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 think,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 again. 1 \u201cWhen 1 he 1 insulted 1 you, 1 how 1 would 1 you 1 have 1 replied?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 hadn\u2019t 1 time 1 to 1 think. 1 You 1 came.\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 but 1 won\u2019t 1 you 1 tell 1 me 1 now 1 what 1 you 1 would 1 have 1 done?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 should 1 have--\u201d 1 She 1 checked 1 herself, 1 and 1 broke 1 the 1 sentence 1 off. 1 She 1 went 1 up 1 to 1 the 1 dripping 1 window 1 and 1 strained 1 her 1 eyes 1 into 1 the 1 darkness. 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 think 1 what 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 done. 1 \u201cCome 1 away 1 from 1 the 1 window, 1 dear,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cYou 1 will 1 be 1 seen 1 from 1 the 1 road.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 obeyed. 1 She 1 was 1 in 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 power. 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 modulate 1 out 1 the 1 key 1 of 1 self-abasement 1 in 1 which 1 she 1 had 1 started. 1 Neither 1 of 1 them 1 referred 1 again 1 to 1 her 1 suggestion 1 that 1 she 1 should 1 speak 1 to 1 George 1 and 1 settle 1 the 1 matter, 1 whatever 1 it 1 was, 1 with 1 him. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 became 1 plaintive. 1 \u201cOh, 1 for 1 a 1 real 1 man! 1 We 1 are 1 only 1 two 1 women, 1 you 1 and 1 I. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 is 1 hopeless. 1 There 1 is 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 but 1 you 1 do 1 not 1 trust 1 him. 1 Oh, 1 for 1 your 1 brother! 1 He 1 is 1 young, 1 but 1 I 1 know 1 that 1 his 1 sister\u2019s 1 insult 1 would 1 rouse 1 in 1 him 1 a 1 very 1 lion. 1 Thank 1 God, 1 chivalry 1 is 1 not 1 yet 1 dead. 1 There 1 are 1 still 1 left 1 some 1 a 1 letter 1 from 1 Miss 1 Catharine 1 Alan; 1 on 1 George 1 Emerson 1 cleaning 1 his 1 father\u2019s 1 boots; 1 and 1 lastly, 1 to 1 complete 1 the 1 catalogue 1 of 1 memorable 1 things, 1 on 1 the 1 red 1 book 1 mentioned 1 previously. 1 The 1 ladies 1 move, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 moves, 1 George 1 moves, 1 and 1 movement 1 may 1 engender 1 shadow. 1 But 1 this 1 book 1 lies 1 motionless, 1 to 1 be 1 caressed 1 all 1 the 1 morning 1 by 1 the 1 sun 1 and 1 to 1 raise 1 its 1 covers 1 slightly, 1 as 1 though 1 acknowledging 1 the 1 caress. 1 Presently 1 Lucy 1 steps 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 drawing-room 1 window. 1 Her 1 new 1 cerise 1 dress 1 has 1 been 1 a 1 failure, 1 and 1 makes 1 her 1 look 1 tawdry 1 and 1 wan. 1 At 1 her 1 throat 1 is 1 a 1 garnet 1 brooch, 1 on 1 her 1 finger 1 a 1 ring 1 set 1 with 1 rubies--an 1 engagement 1 ring. 1 Her 1 eyes 1 are 1 bent 1 to 1 the 1 Weald. 1 She 1 frowns 1 a 1 little--not 1 in 1 anger, 1 but 1 as 1 a 1 brave 1 child 1 frowns 1 when 1 he 1 is 1 trying 1 not 1 to 1 cry. 1 In 1 all 1 that 1 expanse 1 no 1 human 1 eye 1 is 1 looking 1 at 1 her, 1 and 1 she 1 may 1 frown 1 unrebuked 1 and 1 measure 1 the 1 spaces 1 that 1 yet 1 survive 1 between 1 Apollo 1 and 1 the 1 western 1 hills. 1 \u201cLucy! 1 Lucy! 1 What\u2019s 1 that 1 book? 1 Who\u2019s 1 been 1 taking 1 a 1 book 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 shelf 1 and 1 leaving 1 it 1 about 1 to 1 spoil?\u201d 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 only 1 the 1 library 1 book 1 that 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 been 1 reading.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 pick 1 it 1 up, 1 and 1 don\u2019t 1 stand 1 idling 1 there 1 like 1 a 1 flamingo.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 picked 1 up 1 the 1 book 1 and 1 glanced 1 at 1 the 1 title 1 listlessly, 1 Under 1 a 1 Loggia. 1 She 1 no 1 longer 1 read 1 novels 1 herself, 1 devoting 1 all 1 her 1 spare 1 time 1 to 1 solid 1 literature 1 in 1 the 1 hope 1 of 1 catching 1 Cecil 1 up. 1 It 1 was 1 dreadful 1 how 1 little 1 she 1 knew, 1 and 1 even 1 when 1 she 1 thought 1 she 1 knew 1 a 1 thing, 1 like 1 the 1 Italian 1 painters, 1 she 1 found 1 she 1 had 1 forgotten 1 it. 1 Only 1 this 1 morning 1 she 1 had 1 confused 1 Francesco 1 Francia 1 with 1 Piero 1 della 1 Francesca, 1 and 1 Cecil 1 had 1 said, 1 \u201cWhat! 1 you 1 aren\u2019t 1 forgetting 1 your 1 Italy 1 already?\u201d 1 And 1 this 1 too 1 had 1 lent 1 anxiety 1 to 1 her 1 eyes 1 when 1 she 1 saluted 1 the 1 dear 1 view 1 and 1 the 1 dear 1 garden 1 in 1 the 1 foreground, 1 and 1 above 1 them, 1 scarcely 1 conceivable 1 elsewhere, 1 the 1 dear 1 sun. 1 \u201cLucy--have 1 you 1 a 1 sixpence 1 for 1 Minnie 1 and 1 a 1 shilling 1 for 1 yourself?\u201d 1 She 1 hastened 1 in 1 to 1 her 1 mother, 1 who 1 was 1 rapidly 1 working 1 herself 1 into 1 a 1 Sunday 1 fluster. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 a 1 special 1 collection--I 1 forget 1 what 1 for. 1 I 1 do 1 beg, 1 no 1 vulgar 1 clinking 1 in 1 the 1 plate 1 with 1 halfpennies; 1 see 1 that 1 Minnie 1 has 1 a 1 nice 1 bright 1 sixpence. 1 Where 1 is 1 the 1 child? 1 Minnie! 1 That 1 book\u2019s 1 all 1 warped. 1 (Gracious, 1 how 1 plain 1 you 1 look!) 1 Put 1 it 1 under 1 the 1 Atlas 1 to 1 press. 1 Minnie!\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch--\u201d 1 from 1 the 1 upper 1 regions. 1 \u201cMinnie, 1 don\u2019t 1 be 1 late. 1 Here 1 comes 1 the 1 horse\u201d--it 1 was 1 always 1 the 1 horse, 1 never 1 the 1 carriage. 1 \u201cWhere\u2019s 1 Charlotte? 1 Run 1 up 1 and 1 hurry 1 her. 1 Why 1 is 1 she 1 so 1 long? 1 She 1 had 1 nothing 1 to 1 do. 1 She 1 never 1 brings 1 anything 1 but 1 blouses. 1 Poor 1 Charlotte--How 1 I 1 do 1 detest 1 blouses! 1 Minnie!\u201d 1 Paganism 1 is 1 infectious--more 1 infectious 1 than 1 diphtheria 1 or 1 piety--and 1 the 1 Rector\u2019s 1 niece 1 was 1 taken 1 to 1 church 1 protesting. 1 As 1 usual, 1 she 1 didn\u2019t 1 see 1 why. 1 Why 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 she 1 sit 1 in 1 the 1 sun 1 with 1 the 1 young 1 men? 1 The 1 young 1 men, 1 who 1 had 1 now 1 appeared, 1 mocked 1 her 1 with 1 ungenerous 1 words. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 defended 1 orthodoxy, 1 and 1 in 1 the 1 midst 1 of 1 the 1 confusion 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 dressed 1 in 1 the 1 very 1 height 1 of 1 the 1 fashion, 1 came 1 strolling 1 down 1 the 1 stairs. 1 \u201cDear 1 Marian, 1 I 1 am 1 very 1 sorry, 1 but 1 I 1 have 1 no 1 small 1 change--nothing 1 but 1 sovereigns 1 and 1 half 1 crowns. 1 Could 1 any 1 one 1 give 1 me--\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 easily. 1 Jump 1 in. 1 Gracious 1 me, 1 how 1 smart 1 you 1 look! 1 What 1 a 1 lovely 1 frock! 1 You 1 put 1 us 1 all 1 to 1 shame.\u201d 1 \u201cIf 1 I 1 did 1 not 1 wear 1 my 1 best 1 rags 1 and 1 tatters 1 now, 1 when 1 should 1 I 1 wear 1 them?\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 reproachfully. 1 She 1 got 1 into 1 the 1 victoria 1 and 1 placed 1 herself 1 with 1 her 1 back 1 to 1 the 1 horse. 1 The 1 necessary 1 roar 1 ensued, 1 and 1 then 1 they 1 drove 1 off. 1 \u201cGood-bye! 1 Be 1 good!\u201d 1 called 1 out 1 Cecil. 1 Lucy 1 bit 1 her 1 lip, 1 for 1 the 1 tone 1 was 1 sneering. 1 On 1 the 1 subject 1 of 1 \u201cchurch 1 and 1 so 1 on\u201d 1 they 1 had 1 had 1 rather 1 an 1 unsatisfactory 1 conversation. 1 He 1 had 1 said 1 that 1 people 1 ought 1 to 1 overhaul 1 themselves, 1 and 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 want 1 to 1 overhaul 1 herself; 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 know 1 it 1 was 1 done. 1 Honest 1 orthodoxy 1 Cecil 1 respected, 1 but 1 he 1 always 1 assumed 1 that 1 honesty 1 is 1 the 1 result 1 of 1 a 1 spiritual 1 crisis; 1 he 1 could 1 not 1 imagine 1 it 1 as 1 a 1 natural 1 birthright, 1 that 1 might 1 grow 1 heavenward 1 like 1 flowers. 1 All 1 that 1 he 1 said 1 on 1 this 1 subject 1 pained 1 her, 1 though 1 he 1 exuded 1 tolerance 1 from 1 every 1 pore; 1 somehow 1 the 1 Emersons 1 were 1 different. 1 She 1 saw 1 the 1 Emersons 1 after 1 church. 1 There 1 was 1 a 1 line 1 of 1 carriages 1 down 1 the 1 road, 1 and 1 the 1 Honeychurch 1 vehicle 1 happened 1 to 1 be 1 opposite 1 Cissie 1 Villa. 1 To 1 save 1 time, 1 they 1 walked 1 over 1 the 1 green 1 to 1 it, 1 and 1 found 1 father 1 and 1 son 1 smoking 1 in 1 the 1 garden. 1 \u201cIntroduce 1 me,\u201d 1 said 1 her 1 mother. 1 \u201cUnless 1 the 1 young 1 man 1 considers 1 that 1 he 1 knows 1 me 1 already.\u201d 1 He 1 probably 1 did; 1 but 1 Lucy 1 ignored 1 the 1 Sacred 1 Lake 1 and 1 introduced 1 them 1 formally. 1 Old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 claimed 1 her 1 with 1 much 1 warmth, 1 and 1 said 1 how 1 glad 1 he 1 was 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 going 1 to 1 be 1 married. 1 She 1 said 1 yes, 1 she 1 was 1 glad 1 too; 1 and 1 then, 1 as 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 and 1 Minnie 1 were 1 lingering 1 behind 1 with 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 she 1 turned 1 the 1 conversation 1 to 1 a 1 less 1 disturbing 1 topic, 1 and 1 asked 1 him 1 how 1 he 1 liked 1 his 1 new 1 house. 1 \u201cVery 1 much,\u201d 1 he 1 replied, 1 but 1 there 1 was 1 a 1 note 1 of 1 offence 1 in 1 his 1 voice; 1 she 1 had 1 never 1 known 1 him 1 offended 1 before. 1 He 1 added: 1 \u201cWe 1 find, 1 though, 1 that 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 were 1 coming, 1 and 1 that 1 we 1 have 1 turned 1 them 1 out. 1 Women 1 mind 1 such 1 a 1 thing. 1 I 1 am 1 very 1 much 1 upset 1 about 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 believe 1 that 1 there 1 was 1 some 1 misunderstanding,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 uneasily. 1 \u201cOur 1 landlord 1 was 1 told 1 that 1 we 1 should 1 be 1 a 1 different 1 type 1 of 1 person,\u201d 1 said 1 George, 1 who 1 seemed 1 disposed 1 to 1 carry 1 the 1 matter 1 further. 1 \u201cHe 1 thought 1 we 1 should 1 be 1 artistic. 1 He 1 is 1 disappointed.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 I 1 wonder 1 whether 1 we 1 ought 1 to 1 write 1 to 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 and 1 offer 1 to 1 give 1 it 1 up. 1 What 1 do 1 you 1 think?\u201d 1 He 1 appealed 1 to 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cOh, 1 stop 1 now 1 you 1 have 1 come,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 lightly. 1 She 1 must 1 avoid 1 censuring 1 Cecil. 1 For 1 it 1 was 1 on 1 Cecil 1 that 1 the 1 little 1 episode 1 turned, 1 though 1 his 1 name 1 was 1 never 1 mentioned. 1 \u201cSo 1 George 1 says. 1 He 1 says 1 that 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 must 1 go 1 to 1 the 1 wall. 1 Yet 1 it 1 does 1 seem 1 so 1 unkind.\u201d 1 \u201cThere 1 is 1 only 1 a 1 certain 1 amount 1 of 1 kindness 1 in 1 the 1 world,\u201d 1 said 1 George, 1 watching 1 the 1 sunlight 1 flash 1 on 1 the 1 panels 1 of 1 the 1 passing 1 carriages. 1 \u201cYes!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch. 1 \u201cThat\u2019s 1 exactly 1 what 1 I 1 say. 1 Why 1 all 1 this 1 twiddling 1 and 1 twaddling 1 over 1 two 1 Miss 1 Alans?\u201d 1 \u201cThere 1 is 1 a 1 certain 1 amount 1 of 1 kindness, 1 just 1 as 1 there 1 is 1 a 1 certain 1 amount 1 of 1 light,\u201d 1 he 1 continued 1 in 1 measured 1 tones. 1 \u201cWe 1 cast 1 a 1 shadow 1 on 1 something 1 wherever 1 we 1 stand, 1 and 1 it 1 is 1 no 1 good 1 moving 1 from 1 place 1 to 1 place 1 to 1 save 1 things; 1 because 1 the 1 shadow 1 always 1 follows. 1 Choose 1 a 1 place 1 where 1 you 1 won\u2019t 1 do 1 harm--yes, 1 choose 1 a 1 place 1 where 1 you 1 won\u2019t 1 do 1 very 1 much 1 harm, 1 and 1 stand 1 in 1 it 1 for 1 all 1 you 1 are 1 worth, 1 facing 1 the 1 sunshine.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 I 1 see 1 you\u2019re 1 clever!\u201d 1 \u201cEh--?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 see 1 you\u2019re 1 going 1 to 1 be 1 clever. 1 I 1 hope 1 you 1 didn\u2019t 1 go 1 behaving 1 like 1 that 1 to 1 poor 1 Freddy.\u201d 1 George\u2019s 1 eyes 1 laughed, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 suspected 1 that 1 he 1 and 1 her 1 mother 1 would 1 get 1 on 1 rather 1 well. 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 didn\u2019t,\u201d 1 he 1 said. 1 \u201cHe 1 behaved 1 that 1 way 1 to 1 me. 1 It 1 is 1 his 1 philosophy. 1 Only 1 he 1 starts 1 life 1 with 1 it; 1 and 1 I 1 have 1 tried 1 the 1 Note 1 of 1 Interrogation 1 first.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 DO 1 you 1 mean? 1 No, 1 never 1 mind 1 what 1 you 1 mean. 1 Don\u2019t 1 explain. 1 He 1 looks 1 forward 1 to 1 seeing 1 you 1 this 1 afternoon. 1 Do 1 you 1 play 1 tennis? 1 Do 1 you 1 mind 1 tennis 1 on 1 Sunday--?\u201d 1 \u201cGeorge 1 mind 1 tennis 1 on 1 Sunday! 1 George, 1 after 1 his 1 education, 1 distinguish 1 between 1 Sunday--\u201d 1 \u201cVery 1 well, 1 George 1 doesn\u2019t 1 mind 1 tennis 1 on 1 Sunday. 1 No 1 more 1 do 1 I. 1 That\u2019s 1 settled. 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 if 1 you 1 could 1 come 1 with 1 your 1 son 1 we 1 should 1 be 1 so 1 pleased.\u201d 1 He 1 thanked 1 her, 1 but 1 the 1 walk 1 sounded 1 rather 1 far; 1 he 1 could 1 only 1 potter 1 about 1 in 1 these 1 days. 1 She 1 turned 1 to 1 George: 1 \u201cAnd 1 then 1 he 1 wants 1 to 1 give 1 up 1 his 1 house 1 to 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 know,\u201d 1 said 1 George, 1 and 1 put 1 his 1 arm 1 round 1 his 1 father\u2019s 1 neck. 1 The 1 kindness 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 and 1 Lucy 1 had 1 always 1 known 1 to 1 exist 1 in 1 him 1 came 1 out 1 suddenly, 1 like 1 sunlight 1 touching 1 a 1 vast 1 landscape--a 1 touch 1 of 1 the 1 morning 1 sun? 1 She 1 remembered 1 that 1 in 1 all 1 his 1 perversities 1 he 1 had 1 never 1 spoken 1 against 1 affection. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 approached. 1 \u201cYou 1 know 1 our 1 cousin, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 pleasantly. 1 \u201cYou 1 met 1 her 1 with 1 my 1 daughter 1 in 1 Florence.\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 indeed!\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 old 1 man, 1 and 1 made 1 as 1 if 1 he 1 would 1 come 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 garden 1 to 1 meet 1 the 1 lady. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 promptly 1 got 1 into 1 the 1 victoria. 1 Thus 1 entrenched, 1 she 1 emitted 1 a 1 formal 1 bow. 1 It 1 was 1 the 1 pension 1 Bertolini 1 again, 1 the 1 dining-table 1 with 1 the 1 decanters 1 of 1 water 1 and 1 wine. 1 It 1 was 1 the 1 old, 1 old 1 battle 1 of 1 the 1 room 1 with 1 the 1 view. 1 George 1 did 1 not 1 respond 1 to 1 the 1 bow. 1 Like 1 any 1 boy, 1 he 1 blushed 1 and 1 was 1 ashamed; 1 he 1 knew 1 that 1 the 1 chaperon 1 remembered. 1 He 1 said: 1 \u201cI--I\u2019ll 1 come 1 up 1 to 1 tennis 1 if 1 I 1 can 1 manage 1 it,\u201d 1 and 1 went 1 into 1 the 1 house. 1 Perhaps 1 anything 1 that 1 he 1 did 1 would 1 have 1 pleased 1 Lucy, 1 but 1 his 1 awkwardness 1 went 1 straight 1 to 1 her 1 heart; 1 men 1 were 1 not 1 gods 1 after 1 all, 1 but 1 as 1 human 1 and 1 as 1 clumsy 1 as 1 girls; 1 even 1 men 1 might 1 suffer 1 from 1 unexplained 1 desires, 1 and 1 need 1 help. 1 To 1 one 1 of 1 her 1 upbringing, 1 and 1 of 1 her 1 destination, 1 the 1 weakness 1 of 1 men 1 was 1 a 1 truth 1 unfamiliar, 1 but 1 she 1 had 1 surmised 1 it 1 at 1 Florence, 1 when 1 George 1 threw 1 her 1 photographs 1 into 1 the 1 River 1 Arno. 1 \u201cGeorge, 1 don\u2019t 1 go,\u201d 1 cried 1 his 1 father, 1 who 1 thought 1 it 1 a 1 great 1 treat 1 for 1 people 1 if 1 his 1 son 1 would 1 talk 1 to 1 them. 1 \u201cGeorge 1 has 1 been 1 in 1 such 1 good 1 spirits 1 today, 1 and 1 I 1 am 1 sure 1 he 1 will 1 end 1 by 1 coming 1 up 1 this 1 afternoon.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 caught 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 eye. 1 Something 1 in 1 its 1 mute 1 appeal 1 made 1 her 1 reckless. 1 \u201cYes,\u201d 1 she 1 said, 1 raising 1 her 1 voice, 1 \u201cI 1 do 1 hope 1 he 1 will.\u201d 1 Then 1 she 1 went 1 to 1 the 1 carriage 1 and 1 murmured, 1 \u201cThe 1 old 1 man 1 hasn\u2019t 1 been 1 told; 1 I 1 knew 1 it 1 was 1 all 1 right.\u201d 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 followed 1 her, 1 and 1 they 1 drove 1 away. 1 Satisfactory 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 had 1 not 1 been 1 told 1 of 1 the 1 Florence 1 escapade; 1 yet 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 spirits 1 should 1 not 1 have 1 leapt 1 up 1 as 1 if 1 she 1 had 1 sighted 1 the 1 ramparts 1 of 1 heaven. 1 Satisfactory; 1 yet 1 surely 1 she 1 greeted 1 it 1 with 1 disproportionate 1 joy. 1 All 1 the 1 way 1 home 1 the 1 horses\u2019 1 hoofs 1 sang 1 a 1 tune 1 to 1 her: 1 \u201cHe 1 has 1 not 1 told, 1 he 1 has 1 not 1 told.\u201d 1 Her 1 brain 1 expanded 1 the 1 melody: 1 \u201cHe 1 has 1 not 1 told 1 his 1 father--to 1 whom 1 he 1 tells 1 all 1 things. 1 It 1 was 1 not 1 an 1 exploit. 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 laugh 1 at 1", "0", "40242"], "mapper-4-count-output": ["instead 1 what 1 part 1 of 1 the 1 church 1 you 1 want 1 to 1 see. 1 To 1 take 1 you 1 to 1 it 1 will 1 be 1 a 1 real 1 pleasure.\u201d 1 Now, 1 this 1 was 1 abominably 1 impertinent, 1 and 1 she 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 been 1 furious. 1 But 1 it 1 is 1 sometimes 1 as 1 difficult 1 to 1 lose 1 one\u2019s 1 temper 1 as 1 it 1 is 1 difficult 1 at 1 other 1 times 1 to 1 keep 1 it. 1 Lucy 1 could 1 not 1 get 1 cross. 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 an 1 old 1 man, 1 and 1 surely 1 a 1 girl 1 might 1 humour 1 him. 1 On 1 the 1 other 1 hand, 1 his 1 son 1 was 1 a 1 young 1 man, 1 and 1 she 1 felt 1 that 1 a 1 girl 1 ought 1 to 1 be 1 offended 1 with 1 him, 1 or 1 at 1 all 1 events 1 be 1 offended 1 before 1 him. 1 It 1 was 1 at 1 him 1 that 1 she 1 gazed 1 before 1 replying. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 not 1 touchy, 1 I 1 hope. 1 It 1 is 1 the 1 Giottos 1 that 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 see, 1 if 1 you 1 will 1 kindly 1 tell 1 me 1 which 1 they 1 are.\u201d 1 The 1 son 1 nodded. 1 With 1 a 1 look 1 of 1 sombre 1 satisfaction, 1 he 1 led 1 the 1 way 1 to 1 the 1 Peruzzi 1 Chapel. 1 There 1 was 1 a 1 hint 1 of 1 the 1 teacher 1 about 1 him. 1 She 1 felt 1 like 1 a 1 child 1 in 1 school 1 who 1 had 1 answered 1 a 1 question 1 rightly. 1 The 1 chapel 1 was 1 already 1 filled 1 with 1 an 1 earnest 1 congregation, 1 and 1 out 1 of 1 them 1 rose 1 the 1 voice 1 of 1 a 1 lecturer, 1 directing 1 them 1 how 1 to 1 worship 1 Giotto, 1 not 1 by 1 tactful 1 valuations, 1 but 1 by 1 the 1 standards 1 of 1 the 1 spirit. 1 \u201cRemember,\u201d 1 he 1 was 1 saying, 1 \u201cthe 1 facts 1 about 1 this 1 church 1 of 1 Santa 1 Croce; 1 how 1 it 1 was 1 built 1 by 1 faith 1 in 1 the 1 full 1 fervour 1 of 1 medievalism, 1 before 1 any 1 taint 1 of 1 the 1 Renaissance 1 had 1 appeared. 1 Observe 1 how 1 Giotto 1 in 1 these 1 frescoes--now, 1 unhappily, 1 ruined 1 by 1 restoration--is 1 untroubled 1 by 1 the 1 snares 1 of 1 anatomy 1 and 1 perspective. 1 Could 1 anything 1 be 1 more 1 majestic, 1 more 1 pathetic, 1 beautiful, 1 true? 1 How 1 little, 1 we 1 feel, 1 avails 1 knowledge 1 and 1 technical 1 cleverness 1 against 1 a 1 man 1 who 1 truly 1 feels!\u201d 1 \u201cNo!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 in 1 much 1 too 1 loud 1 a 1 voice 1 for 1 church. 1 \u201cRemember 1 nothing 1 of 1 the 1 sort! 1 Built 1 by 1 faith 1 indeed! 1 That 1 simply 1 means 1 the 1 workmen 1 weren\u2019t 1 paid 1 properly. 1 And 1 as 1 for 1 the 1 frescoes, 1 I 1 see 1 no 1 truth 1 in 1 them. 1 Look 1 at 1 that 1 fat 1 man 1 in 1 blue! 1 He 1 must 1 weigh 1 as 1 much 1 as 1 I 1 do, 1 and 1 he 1 is 1 shooting 1 into 1 the 1 sky 1 like 1 an 1 air 1 balloon.\u201d 1 He 1 was 1 referring 1 to 1 the 1 fresco 1 of 1 the 1 \u201cAscension 1 of 1 St. 1 John.\u201d 1 Inside, 1 the 1 lecturer\u2019s 1 voice 1 faltered, 1 as 1 well 1 it 1 might. 1 The 1 audience 1 shifted 1 uneasily, 1 and 1 so 1 did 1 Lucy. 1 She 1 was 1 sure 1 that 1 she 1 ought 1 not 1 to 1 be 1 with 1 these 1 men; 1 but 1 they 1 had 1 cast 1 a 1 spell 1 over 1 her. 1 They 1 were 1 so 1 serious 1 and 1 so 1 strange 1 that 1 she 1 could 1 not 1 remember 1 how 1 to 1 behave. 1 \u201cNow, 1 did 1 this 1 happen, 1 or 1 didn\u2019t 1 it? 1 Yes 1 or 1 no?\u201d 1 George 1 replied: 1 \u201cIt 1 happened 1 like 1 this, 1 if 1 it 1 happened 1 at 1 all. 1 I 1 would 1 rather 1 go 1 up 1 to 1 heaven 1 by 1 myself 1 than 1 be 1 pushed 1 by 1 cherubs; 1 and 1 if 1 I 1 got 1 there 1 I 1 should 1 like 1 my 1 friends 1 to 1 lean 1 out 1 of 1 it, 1 just 1 as 1 they 1 do 1 here.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 will 1 never 1 go 1 up,\u201d 1 said 1 his 1 father. 1 \u201cYou 1 and 1 I, 1 dear 1 boy, 1 will 1 lie 1 at 1 peace 1 in 1 the 1 earth 1 that 1 bore 1 us, 1 and 1 our 1 names 1 will 1 disappear 1 as 1 surely 1 as 1 our 1 work 1 survives.\u201d 1 \u201cSome 1 of 1 the 1 people 1 can 1 only 1 see 1 the 1 empty 1 grave, 1 not 1 the 1 saint, 1 whoever 1 he 1 is, 1 going 1 up. 1 It 1 did 1 happen 1 like 1 that, 1 if 1 it 1 happened 1 at 1 all.\u201d 1 \u201cPardon 1 me,\u201d 1 said 1 a 1 frigid 1 voice. 1 \u201cThe 1 chapel 1 is 1 somewhat 1 small 1 for 1 two 1 parties. 1 We 1 will 1 incommode 1 you 1 no 1 longer.\u201d 1 The 1 lecturer 1 was 1 a 1 clergyman, 1 and 1 his 1 audience 1 must 1 be 1 also 1 his 1 flock, 1 for 1 they 1 held 1 prayer-books 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 guide-books 1 in 1 their 1 hands. 1 They 1 filed 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 chapel 1 in 1 silence. 1 Amongst 1 them 1 were 1 the 1 two 1 little 1 old 1 ladies 1 of 1 the 1 Pension 1 Bertolini--Miss 1 Teresa 1 and 1 Miss 1 Catherine 1 Alan. 1 \u201cStop!\u201d 1 cried 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 \u201cThere\u2019s 1 plenty 1 of 1 room 1 for 1 us 1 all. 1 Stop!\u201d 1 The 1 procession 1 disappeared 1 without 1 a 1 word. 1 Soon 1 the 1 lecturer 1 could 1 be 1 heard 1 in 1 the 1 next 1 chapel, 1 describing 1 the 1 life 1 of 1 St. 1 Francis. 1 \u201cGeorge, 1 I 1 do 1 believe 1 that 1 clergyman 1 is 1 the 1 Brixton 1 curate.\u201d 1 George 1 went 1 into 1 the 1 next 1 chapel 1 and 1 returned, 1 saying 1 \u201cPerhaps 1 he 1 is. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 remember.\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 I 1 had 1 better 1 speak 1 to 1 him 1 and 1 remind 1 him 1 who 1 I 1 am. 1 It\u2019s 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Eager. 1 Why 1 did 1 he 1 go? 1 Did 1 we 1 talk 1 too 1 loud? 1 How 1 vexatious. 1 I 1 shall 1 go 1 and 1 say 1 we 1 are 1 sorry. 1 Hadn\u2019t 1 I 1 better? 1 Then 1 perhaps 1 he 1 will 1 come 1 back.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 will 1 not 1 come 1 back,\u201d 1 said 1 George. 1 But 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 contrite 1 and 1 unhappy, 1 hurried 1 away 1 to 1 apologize 1 to 1 the 1 Rev. 1 Cuthbert 1 Eager. 1 Lucy, 1 apparently 1 absorbed 1 in 1 a 1 lunette, 1 could 1 hear 1 the 1 lecture 1 again 1 interrupted, 1 the 1 anxious, 1 aggressive 1 voice 1 of 1 the 1 old 1 man, 1 the 1 curt, 1 injured 1 replies 1 of 1 his 1 opponent. 1 The 1 son, 1 who 1 took 1 every 1 little 1 contretemps 1 as 1 if 1 it 1 were 1 a 1 tragedy, 1 was 1 listening 1 also. 1 \u201cMy 1 father 1 has 1 that 1 effect 1 on 1 nearly 1 everyone,\u201d 1 he 1 informed 1 her. 1 \u201cHe 1 will 1 try 1 to 1 be 1 kind.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 hope 1 we 1 all 1 try,\u201d 1 said 1 she, 1 smiling 1 nervously. 1 \u201cBecause 1 we 1 think 1 it 1 improves 1 our 1 characters. 1 But 1 he 1 is 1 kind 1 to 1 people 1 because 1 he 1 loves 1 them; 1 and 1 they 1 find 1 him 1 out, 1 and 1 are 1 offended, 1 or 1 frightened.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 silly 1 of 1 them!\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 though 1 in 1 her 1 heart 1 she 1 sympathized; 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 that 1 a 1 kind 1 action 1 done 1 tactfully--\u201d 1 \u201cTact!\u201d 1 He 1 threw 1 up 1 his 1 head 1 in 1 disdain. 1 Apparently 1 she 1 had 1 given 1 the 1 wrong 1 answer. 1 She 1 watched 1 the 1 singular 1 creature 1 pace 1 up 1 and 1 down 1 the 1 chapel. 1 For 1 a 1 young 1 man 1 his 1 face 1 was 1 rugged, 1 and--until 1 the 1 shadows 1 fell 1 upon 1 it--hard. 1 Enshadowed, 1 it 1 sprang 1 into 1 tenderness. 1 She 1 saw 1 him 1 once 1 again 1 at 1 Rome, 1 on 1 the 1 ceiling 1 of 1 the 1 Sistine 1 Chapel, 1 carrying 1 a 1 burden 1 of 1 acorns. 1 Healthy 1 and 1 muscular, 1 he 1 yet 1 gave 1 her 1 the 1 feeling 1 of 1 greyness, 1 of 1 tragedy 1 that 1 might 1 only 1 find 1 solution 1 in 1 the 1 night. 1 The 1 feeling 1 soon 1 passed; 1 it 1 was 1 unlike 1 her 1 to 1 have 1 entertained 1 anything 1 so 1 subtle. 1 Born 1 of 1 silence 1 and 1 of 1 unknown 1 emotion, 1 it 1 passed 1 when 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 returned, 1 and 1 she 1 could 1 re-enter 1 the 1 world 1 of 1 rapid 1 talk, 1 which 1 was 1 alone 1 familiar 1 to 1 her. 1 \u201cWere 1 you 1 snubbed?\u201d 1 asked 1 his 1 son 1 tranquilly. 1 \u201cBut 1 we 1 have 1 spoilt 1 the 1 pleasure 1 of 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 how 1 many 1 people. 1 They 1 won\u2019t 1 come 1 back.\u201d 1 \u201c...full 1 of 1 innate 1 sympathy...quickness 1 to 1 perceive 1 good 1 in 1 others...vision 1 of 1 the 1 brotherhood 1 of 1 man...\u201d 1 Scraps 1 of 1 the 1 lecture 1 on 1 St. 1 Francis 1 came 1 floating 1 round 1 the 1 partition 1 wall. 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 let 1 us 1 spoil 1 yours,\u201d 1 he 1 continued 1 to 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cHave 1 you 1 looked 1 at 1 those 1 saints?\u201d 1 \u201cYes,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cThey 1 are 1 lovely. 1 Do 1 you 1 know 1 which 1 is 1 the 1 tombstone 1 that 1 is 1 praised 1 in 1 Ruskin?\u201d 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 know, 1 and 1 suggested 1 that 1 they 1 should 1 try 1 to 1 guess 1 it. 1 George, 1 rather 1 to 1 her 1 relief, 1 refused 1 to 1 move, 1 and 1 she 1 and 1 the 1 old 1 man 1 wandered 1 not 1 unpleasantly 1 about 1 Santa 1 Croce, 1 which, 1 though 1 it 1 is 1 like 1 a 1 barn, 1 has 1 harvested 1 many 1 beautiful 1 things 1 inside 1 its 1 walls. 1 There 1 were 1 also 1 beggars 1 to 1 avoid 1 and 1 guides 1 to 1 dodge 1 round 1 the 1 pillars, 1 and 1 an 1 old 1 lady 1 with 1 her 1 dog, 1 and 1 here 1 and 1 there 1 a 1 priest 1 modestly 1 edging 1 to 1 his 1 Mass 1 through 1 the 1 groups 1 of 1 tourists. 1 But 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 only 1 half 1 interested. 1 He 1 watched 1 the 1 lecturer, 1 whose 1 success 1 he 1 believed 1 he 1 had 1 impaired, 1 and 1 then 1 he 1 anxiously 1 watched 1 his 1 son. 1 \u201cWhy 1 will 1 he 1 look 1 at 1 that 1 fresco?\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 uneasily. 1 \u201cI 1 saw 1 nothing 1 in 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 like 1 Giotto,\u201d 1 she 1 replied. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 so 1 wonderful 1 what 1 they 1 say 1 about 1 his 1 tactile 1 values. 1 Though 1 I 1 like 1 things 1 like 1 the 1 Della 1 Robbia 1 babies 1 better.\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 you 1 ought. 1 A 1 baby 1 is 1 worth 1 a 1 dozen 1 saints. 1 And 1 my 1 baby\u2019s 1 worth 1 the 1 whole 1 of 1 Paradise, 1 and 1 as 1 far 1 as 1 I 1 can 1 see 1 he 1 lives 1 in 1 Hell.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 again 1 felt 1 that 1 this 1 did 1 not 1 do. 1 \u201cIn 1 Hell,\u201d 1 he 1 repeated. 1 \u201cHe\u2019s 1 unhappy.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 dear!\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cHow 1 can 1 he 1 be 1 unhappy 1 when 1 he 1 is 1 strong 1 and 1 alive? 1 What 1 more 1 is 1 one 1 to 1 give 1 him? 1 And 1 think 1 how 1 he 1 has 1 been 1 brought 1 up--free 1 from 1 all 1 the 1 superstition 1 and 1 ignorance 1 that 1 lead 1 men 1 to 1 hate 1 one 1 another 1 in 1 the 1 name 1 of 1 God. 1 With 1 such 1 an 1 education 1 as 1 that, 1 I 1 thought 1 he 1 was 1 bound 1 to 1 grow 1 up 1 happy.\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 no 1 theologian, 1 but 1 she 1 felt 1 that 1 here 1 was 1 a 1 very 1 foolish 1 old 1 man, 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 a 1 very 1 irreligious 1 one. 1 She 1 also 1 felt 1 that 1 her 1 mother 1 might 1 not 1 like 1 her 1 talking 1 to 1 that 1 kind 1 of 1 person, 1 and 1 that 1 Charlotte 1 would 1 object 1 most 1 strongly. 1 \u201cWhat 1 are 1 we 1 to 1 do 1 with 1 him?\u201d 1 he 1 asked. 1 \u201cHe 1 comes 1 out 1 for 1 his 1 holiday 1 to 1 Italy, 1 and 1 behaves--like 1 that; 1 like 1 the 1 little 1 child 1 who 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 been 1 playing, 1 and 1 who 1 hurt 1 himself 1 upon 1 the 1 tombstone. 1 Eh? 1 What 1 did 1 you 1 say?\u201d 1 Lucy 1 had 1 made 1 no 1 suggestion. 1 Suddenly 1 he 1 said: 1 \u201cNow 1 don\u2019t 1 be 1 stupid 1 over 1 this. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 require 1 you 1 to 1 fall 1 in 1 love 1 with 1 my 1 boy, 1 but 1 I 1 do 1 think 1 you 1 might 1 try 1 and 1 understand 1 him. 1 You 1 are 1 nearer 1 his 1 age, 1 and 1 if 1 you 1 let 1 yourself 1 go 1 I 1 am 1 sure 1 you 1 are 1 sensible. 1 You 1 might 1 help 1 me. 1 He 1 has 1 known 1 so 1 few 1 women, 1 and 1 you 1 have 1 the 1 time. 1 You 1 stop 1 here 1 several 1 weeks, 1 I 1 suppose? 1 But 1 let 1 yourself 1 go. 1 You 1 are 1 inclined 1 to 1 get 1 muddled, 1 if 1 I 1 may 1 judge 1 from 1 last 1 night. 1 Let 1 yourself 1 go. 1 Pull 1 out 1 from 1 the 1 depths 1 those 1 thoughts 1 that 1 you 1 do 1 not 1 understand, 1 and 1 spread 1 them 1 out 1 in 1 the 1 sunlight 1 and 1 know 1 the 1 meaning 1 of 1 them. 1 By 1 understanding 1 George 1 you 1 may 1 learn 1 to 1 understand 1 yourself. 1 It 1 will 1 be 1 good 1 for 1 both 1 of 1 you.\u201d 1 To 1 this 1 extraordinary 1 speech 1 Lucy 1 found 1 no 1 answer. 1 \u201cI 1 only 1 know 1 what 1 it 1 is 1 that\u2019s 1 wrong 1 with 1 him; 1 not 1 why 1 it 1 is.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 what 1 is 1 it?\u201d 1 asked 1 Lucy 1 fearfully, 1 expecting 1 some 1 harrowing 1 tale. 1 \u201cThe 1 old 1 trouble; 1 things 1 won\u2019t 1 fit.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 things?\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 things 1 of 1 the 1 universe. 1 It 1 is 1 quite 1 true. 1 They 1 don\u2019t.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 whatever 1 do 1 you 1 mean?\u201d 1 In 1 his 1 ordinary 1 voice, 1 so 1 that 1 she 1 scarcely 1 realized 1 he 1 was 1 quoting 1 poetry, 1 he 1 said: 1 \u201c\u2018From 1 far, 1 from 1 eve 1 and 1 morning, 1 And 1 yon 1 twelve-winded 1 sky, 1 The 1 stuff 1 of 1 life 1 to 1 knit 1 me 1 Blew 1 hither: 1 here 1 am 1 I\u2019 1 George 1 and 1 I 1 both 1 know 1 this, 1 but 1 why 1 does 1 it 1 distress 1 him? 1 We 1 know 1 that 1 we 1 come 1 from 1 the 1 winds, 1 and 1 that 1 we 1 shall 1 return 1 to 1 them; 1 that 1 all 1 life 1 is 1 perhaps 1 a 1 knot, 1 a 1 tangle, 1 a 1 blemish 1 in 1 the 1 eternal 1 smoothness. 1 But 1 why 1 should 1 this 1 make 1 us 1 unhappy? 1 Let 1 us 1 rather 1 love 1 one 1 another, 1 and 1 work 1 and 1 rejoice. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 believe 1 in 1 this 1 world 1 sorrow.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 assented. 1 \u201cThen 1 make 1 my 1 boy 1 think 1 like 1 us. 1 Make 1 him 1 realize 1 that 1 by 1 the 1 side 1 of 1 the 1 everlasting 1 Why 1 there 1 is 1 a 1 Yes--a 1 transitory 1 Yes 1 if 1 you 1 like, 1 but 1 a 1 Yes.\u201d 1 Suddenly 1 she 1 laughed; 1 surely 1 one 1 ought 1 to 1 laugh. 1 A 1 young 1 man 1 melancholy 1 because 1 the 1 universe 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 fit, 1 because 1 life 1 was 1 a 1 tangle 1 or 1 a 1 wind, 1 or 1 a 1 Yes, 1 or 1 something! 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 very 1 sorry,\u201d 1 she 1 cried. 1 \u201cYou\u2019ll 1 think 1 me 1 unfeeling, 1 but--but--\u201d 1 Then 1 she 1 became 1 matronly. 1 \u201cOh, 1 but 1 your 1 son 1 wants 1 employment. 1 Has 1 he 1 no 1 particular 1 men 1 who 1 can 1 reverence 1 woman.\u201d 1 As 1 she 1 spoke, 1 she 1 pulled 1 off 1 her 1 rings, 1 of 1 which 1 she 1 wore 1 several, 1 and 1 ranged 1 them 1 upon 1 the 1 pin 1 cushion. 1 Then 1 she 1 blew 1 into 1 her 1 gloves 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cIt 1 will 1 be 1 a 1 push 1 to 1 catch 1 the 1 morning 1 train, 1 but 1 we 1 must 1 try.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 train?\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 train 1 to 1 Rome.\u201d 1 She 1 looked 1 at 1 her 1 gloves 1 critically. 1 The 1 girl 1 received 1 the 1 announcement 1 as 1 easily 1 as 1 it 1 had 1 been 1 given. 1 \u201cWhen 1 does 1 the 1 train 1 to 1 Rome 1 go?\u201d 1 \u201cAt 1 eight.\u201d 1 \u201cSignora 1 Bertolini 1 would 1 be 1 upset.\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 must 1 face 1 that,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 not 1 liking 1 to 1 say 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 given 1 notice 1 already. 1 \u201cShe 1 will 1 make 1 us 1 pay 1 for 1 a 1 whole 1 week\u2019s 1 pension.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 expect 1 she 1 will. 1 However, 1 we 1 shall 1 be 1 much 1 more 1 comfortable 1 at 1 the 1 Vyses\u2019 1 hotel. 1 Isn\u2019t 1 afternoon 1 tea 1 given 1 there 1 for 1 nothing?\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 but 1 they 1 pay 1 extra 1 for 1 wine.\u201d 1 After 1 this 1 remark 1 she 1 remained 1 motionless 1 and 1 silent. 1 To 1 her 1 tired 1 eyes 1 Charlotte 1 throbbed 1 and 1 swelled 1 like 1 a 1 ghostly 1 figure 1 in 1 a 1 dream. 1 They 1 began 1 to 1 sort 1 their 1 clothes 1 for 1 packing, 1 for 1 there 1 was 1 no 1 time 1 to 1 lose, 1 if 1 they 1 were 1 to 1 catch 1 the 1 train 1 to 1 Rome. 1 Lucy, 1 when 1 admonished, 1 began 1 to 1 move 1 to 1 and 1 fro 1 between 1 the 1 rooms, 1 more 1 conscious 1 of 1 the 1 discomforts 1 of 1 packing 1 by 1 candlelight 1 than 1 of 1 a 1 subtler 1 ill. 1 Charlotte, 1 who 1 was 1 practical 1 without 1 ability, 1 knelt 1 by 1 the 1 side 1 of 1 an 1 empty 1 trunk, 1 vainly 1 endeavouring 1 to 1 pave 1 it 1 with 1 books 1 of 1 varying 1 thickness 1 and 1 size. 1 She 1 gave 1 two 1 or 1 three 1 sighs, 1 for 1 the 1 stooping 1 posture 1 hurt 1 her 1 back, 1 and, 1 for 1 all 1 her 1 diplomacy, 1 she 1 felt 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 growing 1 old. 1 The 1 girl 1 heard 1 her 1 as 1 she 1 entered 1 the 1 room, 1 and 1 was 1 seized 1 with 1 one 1 of 1 those 1 emotional 1 impulses 1 to 1 which 1 she 1 could 1 never 1 attribute 1 a 1 cause. 1 She 1 only 1 felt 1 that 1 the 1 candle 1 would 1 burn 1 better, 1 the 1 packing 1 go 1 easier, 1 the 1 world 1 be 1 happier, 1 if 1 she 1 could 1 give 1 and 1 receive 1 some 1 human 1 love. 1 The 1 impulse 1 had 1 come 1 before 1 to-day, 1 but 1 never 1 so 1 strongly. 1 She 1 knelt 1 down 1 by 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 side 1 and 1 took 1 her 1 in 1 her 1 arms. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 returned 1 the 1 embrace 1 with 1 tenderness 1 and 1 warmth. 1 But 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 a 1 stupid 1 woman, 1 and 1 she 1 knew 1 perfectly 1 well 1 that 1 Lucy 1 did 1 not 1 love 1 her, 1 but 1 needed 1 her 1 to 1 love. 1 For 1 it 1 was 1 in 1 ominous 1 tones 1 that 1 she 1 said, 1 after 1 a 1 long 1 pause: 1 \u201cDearest 1 Lucy, 1 how 1 will 1 you 1 ever 1 forgive 1 me?\u201d 1 Lucy 1 was 1 on 1 her 1 guard 1 at 1 once, 1 knowing 1 by 1 bitter 1 experience 1 what 1 forgiving 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 meant. 1 Her 1 emotion 1 relaxed, 1 she 1 modified 1 her 1 embrace 1 a 1 little, 1 and 1 she 1 said: 1 \u201cCharlotte 1 dear, 1 what 1 do 1 you 1 mean? 1 As 1 if 1 I 1 have 1 anything 1 to 1 forgive!\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 have 1 a 1 great 1 deal, 1 and 1 I 1 have 1 a 1 very 1 great 1 deal 1 to 1 forgive 1 myself, 1 too. 1 I 1 know 1 well 1 how 1 much 1 I 1 vex 1 you 1 at 1 every 1 turn.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 no--\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 assumed 1 her 1 favourite 1 role, 1 that 1 of 1 the 1 prematurely 1 aged 1 martyr. 1 \u201cAh, 1 but 1 yes! 1 I 1 feel 1 that 1 our 1 tour 1 together 1 is 1 hardly 1 the 1 success 1 I 1 had 1 hoped. 1 I 1 might 1 have 1 known 1 it 1 would 1 not 1 do. 1 You 1 want 1 someone 1 younger 1 and 1 stronger 1 and 1 more 1 in 1 sympathy 1 with 1 you. 1 I 1 am 1 too 1 uninteresting 1 and 1 old-fashioned--only 1 fit 1 to 1 pack 1 and 1 unpack 1 your 1 things.\u201d 1 \u201cPlease--\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 only 1 consolation 1 was 1 that 1 you 1 found 1 people 1 more 1 to 1 your 1 taste, 1 and 1 were 1 often 1 able 1 to 1 leave 1 me 1 at 1 home. 1 I 1 had 1 my 1 own 1 poor 1 ideas 1 of 1 what 1 a 1 lady 1 ought 1 to 1 do, 1 but 1 I 1 hope 1 I 1 did 1 not 1 inflict 1 them 1 on 1 you 1 more 1 than 1 was 1 necessary. 1 You 1 had 1 your 1 own 1 way 1 about 1 these 1 rooms, 1 at 1 all 1 events.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 mustn\u2019t 1 say 1 these 1 things,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 softly. 1 She 1 still 1 clung 1 to 1 the 1 hope 1 that 1 she 1 and 1 Charlotte 1 loved 1 each 1 other, 1 heart 1 and 1 soul. 1 They 1 continued 1 to 1 pack 1 in 1 silence. 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 been 1 a 1 failure,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 as 1 she 1 struggled 1 with 1 the 1 straps 1 of 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 trunk 1 instead 1 of 1 strapping 1 her 1 own. 1 \u201cFailed 1 to 1 make 1 you 1 happy; 1 failed 1 in 1 my 1 duty 1 to 1 your 1 mother. 1 She 1 has 1 been 1 so 1 generous 1 to 1 me; 1 I 1 shall 1 never 1 face 1 her 1 again 1 after 1 this 1 disaster.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 mother 1 will 1 understand. 1 It 1 is 1 not 1 your 1 fault, 1 this 1 trouble, 1 and 1 it 1 isn\u2019t 1 a 1 disaster 1 either.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 my 1 fault, 1 it 1 is 1 a 1 disaster. 1 She 1 will 1 never 1 forgive 1 me, 1 and 1 rightly. 1 For 1 instance, 1 what 1 right 1 had 1 I 1 to 1 make 1 friends 1 with 1 Miss 1 Lavish?\u201d 1 \u201cEvery 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cWhen 1 I 1 was 1 here 1 for 1 your 1 sake? 1 If 1 I 1 have 1 vexed 1 you 1 it 1 is 1 equally 1 true 1 that 1 I 1 have 1 neglected 1 you. 1 Your 1 mother 1 will 1 see 1 this 1 as 1 clearly 1 as 1 I 1 do, 1 when 1 you 1 tell 1 her.\u201d 1 Lucy, 1 from 1 a 1 cowardly 1 wish 1 to 1 improve 1 the 1 situation, 1 said: 1 \u201cWhy 1 need 1 mother 1 hear 1 of 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 you 1 tell 1 her 1 everything?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 suppose 1 I 1 do 1 generally.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 dare 1 not 1 break 1 your 1 confidence. 1 There 1 is 1 something 1 sacred 1 in 1 it. 1 Unless 1 you 1 feel 1 that 1 it 1 is 1 a 1 thing 1 you 1 could 1 not 1 tell 1 her.\u201d 1 The 1 girl 1 would 1 not 1 be 1 degraded 1 to 1 this. 1 \u201cNaturally 1 I 1 should 1 have 1 told 1 her. 1 But 1 in 1 case 1 she 1 should 1 blame 1 you 1 in 1 any 1 way, 1 I 1 promise 1 I 1 will 1 not, 1 I 1 am 1 very 1 willing 1 not 1 to. 1 I 1 will 1 never 1 speak 1 of 1 it 1 either 1 to 1 her 1 or 1 to 1 any 1 one.\u201d 1 Her 1 promise 1 brought 1 the 1 long-drawn 1 interview 1 to 1 a 1 sudden 1 close. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 pecked 1 her 1 smartly 1 on 1 both 1 cheeks, 1 wished 1 her 1 good-night, 1 and 1 sent 1 her 1 to 1 her 1 own 1 room. 1 For 1 a 1 moment 1 the 1 original 1 trouble 1 was 1 in 1 the 1 background. 1 George 1 would 1 seem 1 to 1 have 1 behaved 1 like 1 a 1 cad 1 throughout; 1 perhaps 1 that 1 was 1 the 1 view 1 which 1 one 1 would 1 take 1 eventually. 1 At 1 present 1 she 1 neither 1 acquitted 1 nor 1 condemned 1 him; 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 pass 1 judgement. 1 At 1 the 1 moment 1 when 1 she 1 was 1 about 1 to 1 judge 1 him 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 voice 1 had 1 intervened, 1 and, 1 ever 1 since, 1 it 1 was 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 who 1 had 1 dominated; 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 who, 1 even 1 now, 1 could 1 be 1 heard 1 sighing 1 into 1 a 1 crack 1 in 1 the 1 partition 1 wall; 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 had 1 really 1 been 1 neither 1 pliable 1 nor 1 humble 1 nor 1 inconsistent. 1 She 1 had 1 worked 1 like 1 a 1 great 1 artist; 1 for 1 a 1 time--indeed, 1 for 1 years--she 1 had 1 been 1 meaningless, 1 but 1 at 1 the 1 end 1 there 1 was 1 presented 1 to 1 the 1 girl 1 the 1 complete 1 picture 1 of 1 a 1 cheerless, 1 loveless 1 world 1 in 1 which 1 the 1 young 1 rush 1 to 1 destruction 1 until 1 they 1 learn 1 better--a 1 shamefaced 1 world 1 of 1 precautions 1 and 1 barriers 1 which 1 may 1 avert 1 evil, 1 but 1 which 1 do 1 not 1 seem 1 to 1 bring 1 good, 1 if 1 we 1 may 1 judge 1 from 1 those 1 who 1 have 1 used 1 them 1 most. 1 Lucy 1 was 1 suffering 1 from 1 the 1 most 1 grievous 1 wrong 1 which 1 this 1 world 1 has 1 yet 1 discovered: 1 diplomatic 1 advantage 1 had 1 been 1 taken 1 of 1 her 1 sincerity, 1 of 1 her 1 craving 1 for 1 sympathy 1 and 1 love. 1 Such 1 a 1 wrong 1 is 1 not 1 easily 1 forgotten. 1 Never 1 again 1 did 1 she 1 expose 1 herself 1 without 1 due 1 consideration 1 and 1 precaution 1 against 1 rebuff. 1 And 1 such 1 a 1 wrong 1 may 1 react 1 disastrously 1 upon 1 the 1 soul. 1 The 1 door-bell 1 rang, 1 and 1 she 1 started 1 to 1 the 1 shutters. 1 Before 1 she 1 reached 1 them 1 she 1 hesitated, 1 turned, 1 and 1 blew 1 out 1 the 1 candle. 1 Thus 1 it 1 was 1 that, 1 though 1 she 1 saw 1 someone 1 standing 1 in 1 the 1 wet 1 below, 1 he, 1 though 1 he 1 looked 1 up, 1 did 1 not 1 see 1 her. 1 To 1 reach 1 his 1 room 1 he 1 had 1 to 1 go 1 by 1 hers. 1 She 1 was 1 still 1 dressed. 1 It 1 struck 1 her 1 that 1 she 1 might 1 slip 1 into 1 the 1 passage 1 and 1 just 1 say 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 be 1 gone 1 before 1 he 1 was 1 up, 1 and 1 that 1 their 1 extraordinary 1 intercourse 1 was 1 over. 1 Whether 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 dared 1 to 1 do 1 this 1 was 1 never 1 proved. 1 At 1 the 1 critical 1 moment 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 opened 1 her 1 own 1 door, 1 and 1 her 1 voice 1 said: 1 \u201cI 1 wish 1 one 1 word 1 with 1 you 1 in 1 the 1 drawing-room, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 please.\u201d 1 Soon 1 their 1 footsteps 1 returned, 1 and 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 said: 1 \u201cGood-night, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson.\u201d 1 His 1 heavy, 1 tired 1 breathing 1 was 1 the 1 only 1 reply; 1 the 1 chaperon 1 had 1 done 1 her 1 work. 1 Lucy 1 cried 1 aloud: 1 \u201cIt 1 isn\u2019t 1 true. 1 It 1 can\u2019t 1 all 1 be 1 true. 1 I 1 want 1 not 1 to 1 be 1 muddled. 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 grow 1 older 1 quickly.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 tapped 1 on 1 the 1 wall. 1 \u201cGo 1 to 1 bed 1 at 1 once, 1 dear. 1 You 1 need 1 all 1 the 1 rest 1 you 1 can 1 get.\u201d 1 In 1 the 1 morning 1 they 1 left 1 for 1 Rome. 1 Part 1 Two 1 Chapter 1 VIII: 1 Medieval 1 The 1 drawing-room 1 curtains 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 had 1 been 1 pulled 1 to 1 meet, 1 for 1 the 1 carpet 1 was 1 new 1 and 1 deserved 1 protection 1 from 1 the 1 August 1 sun. 1 They 1 were 1 heavy 1 curtains, 1 reaching 1 almost 1 to 1 the 1 ground, 1 and 1 the 1 light 1 that 1 filtered 1 through 1 them 1 was 1 subdued 1 and 1 varied. 1 A 1 poet--none 1 was 1 present--might 1 have 1 quoted, 1 \u201cLife 1 like 1 a 1 dome 1 of 1 many 1 coloured 1 glass,\u201d 1 or 1 might 1 have 1 compared 1 the 1 curtains 1 to 1 sluice-gates, 1 lowered 1 against 1 the 1 intolerable 1 tides 1 of 1 heaven. 1 Without 1 was 1 poured 1 a 1 sea 1 of 1 radiance; 1 within, 1 the 1 glory, 1 though 1 visible, 1 was 1 tempered 1 to 1 the 1 capacities 1 of 1 man. 1 Two 1 pleasant 1 people 1 sat 1 in 1 the 1 room. 1 One--a 1 boy 1 of 1 nineteen--was 1 studying 1 a 1 small 1 manual 1 of 1 anatomy, 1 and 1 peering 1 occasionally 1 at 1 a 1 bone 1 which 1 lay 1 upon 1 the 1 piano. 1 From 1 time 1 to 1 time 1 he 1 bounced 1 in 1 his 1 chair 1 and 1 puffed 1 and 1 groaned, 1 for 1 the 1 day 1 was 1 hot 1 and 1 the 1 print 1 small, 1 and 1 the 1 human 1 frame 1 fearfully 1 made; 1 and 1 his 1 mother, 1 who 1 was 1 writing 1 a 1 letter, 1 did 1 continually 1 read 1 out 1 to 1 him 1 what 1 she 1 had 1 written. 1 And 1 continually 1 did 1 she 1 rise 1 from 1 her 1 seat 1 and 1 part 1 the 1 curtains 1 so 1 that 1 a 1 rivulet 1 of 1 light 1 fell 1 across 1 the 1 carpet, 1 and 1 make 1 the 1 remark 1 that 1 they 1 were 1 still 1 there. 1 \u201cWhere 1 aren\u2019t 1 they?\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 boy, 1 who 1 was 1 Freddy, 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 brother. 1 \u201cI 1 tell 1 you 1 I\u2019m 1 getting 1 fairly 1 sick.\u201d 1 \u201cFor 1 goodness\u2019 1 sake 1 go 1 out 1 of 1 my 1 drawing-room, 1 then?\u201d 1 cried 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 who 1 hoped 1 to 1 cure 1 her 1 children 1 of 1 slang 1 by 1 taking 1 it 1 literally. 1 Freddy 1 did 1 not 1 move 1 or 1 reply. 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 things 1 are 1 coming 1 to 1 a 1 head,\u201d 1 she 1 observed, 1 rather 1 wanting 1 her 1 son\u2019s 1 opinion 1 on 1 the 1 situation 1 if 1 she 1 could 1 obtain 1 it 1 without 1 undue 1 supplication. 1 \u201cTime 1 they 1 did.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 glad 1 that 1 Cecil 1 is 1 asking 1 her 1 this 1 once 1 more.\u201d 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 his 1 third 1 go, 1 isn\u2019t 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cFreddy 1 I 1 do 1 call 1 the 1 way 1 you 1 talk 1 unkind.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 didn\u2019t 1 mean 1 to 1 be 1 unkind.\u201d 1 Then 1 he 1 added: 1 \u201cBut 1 I 1 do 1 think 1 Lucy 1 might 1 have 1 got 1 this 1 off 1 her 1 chest 1 in 1 Italy. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 how 1 girls 1 manage 1 things, 1 but 1 she 1 can\u2019t 1 have 1 said 1 \u2018No\u2019 1 properly 1 before, 1 or 1 she 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 have 1 to 1 say 1 it 1 again 1 now. 1 Over 1 the 1 whole 1 thing--I 1 can\u2019t 1 explain--I 1 do 1 feel 1 so 1 uncomfortable.\u201d 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 indeed, 1 dear? 1 How 1 interesting!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 feel--never 1 mind.\u201d 1 He 1 returned 1 to 1 his 1 work. 1 \u201cJust 1 listen 1 to 1 what 1 I 1 have 1 written 1 to 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse. 1 I 1 said: 1 \u2018Dear 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse.\u2019\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 mother, 1 you 1 told 1 me. 1 A 1 jolly 1 good 1 letter.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 said: 1 \u2018Dear 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse, 1 Cecil 1 has 1 just 1 asked 1 my 1 permission 1 about 1 it, 1 and 1 I 1 should 1 be 1 delighted, 1 if 1 Lucy 1 wishes 1 it. 1 But--\u2019\u201d 1 She 1 stopped 1 reading, 1 \u201cI 1 was 1 rather 1 amused 1 at 1 Cecil 1 asking 1 my 1 permission 1 at 1 all. 1 He 1 has 1 always 1 gone 1 in 1 for 1 unconventionality, 1 and 1 parents 1 nowhere, 1 and 1 so 1 forth. 1 When 1 it 1 comes 1 to 1 the 1 point, 1 he 1 can\u2019t 1 get 1 on 1 without 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cNor 1 And 1 immediately 1 she 1 realized 1 that 1 this 1 was 1 what 1 her 1 cousin 1 had 1 intended 1 all 1 along. 1 \u201cHullo, 1 Emerson!\u201d 1 called 1 Freddy 1 from 1 below. 1 \u201cFound 1 the 1 lost 1 ball? 1 Good 1 man! 1 Want 1 any 1 tea?\u201d 1 And 1 there 1 was 1 an 1 irruption 1 from 1 the 1 house 1 on 1 to 1 the 1 terrace. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Lucy, 1 but 1 that 1 is 1 brave 1 of 1 you! 1 I 1 admire 1 you--\u201d 1 They 1 had 1 gathered 1 round 1 George, 1 who 1 beckoned, 1 she 1 felt, 1 over 1 the 1 rubbish, 1 the 1 sloppy 1 thoughts, 1 the 1 furtive 1 yearnings 1 that 1 were 1 beginning 1 to 1 cumber 1 her 1 soul. 1 Her 1 anger 1 faded 1 at 1 the 1 sight 1 of 1 him. 1 Ah! 1 The 1 Emersons 1 were 1 fine 1 people 1 in 1 their 1 way. 1 She 1 had 1 to 1 subdue 1 a 1 rush 1 in 1 her 1 blood 1 before 1 saying: 1 \u201cFreddy 1 has 1 taken 1 him 1 into 1 the 1 dining-room. 1 The 1 others 1 are 1 going 1 down 1 the 1 garden. 1 Come. 1 Let 1 us 1 get 1 this 1 over 1 quickly. 1 Come. 1 I 1 want 1 you 1 in 1 the 1 room, 1 of 1 course.\u201d 1 \u201cLucy, 1 do 1 you 1 mind 1 doing 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 can 1 you 1 ask 1 such 1 a 1 ridiculous 1 question?\u201d 1 \u201cPoor 1 Lucy--\u201d 1 She 1 stretched 1 out 1 her 1 hand. 1 \u201cI 1 seem 1 to 1 bring 1 nothing 1 but 1 misfortune 1 wherever 1 I 1 go.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 nodded. 1 She 1 remembered 1 their 1 last 1 evening 1 at 1 Florence--the 1 packing, 1 the 1 candle, 1 the 1 shadow 1 of 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 toque 1 on 1 the 1 door. 1 She 1 was 1 not 1 to 1 be 1 trapped 1 by 1 pathos 1 a 1 second 1 time. 1 Eluding 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 caress, 1 she 1 led 1 the 1 way 1 downstairs. 1 \u201cTry 1 the 1 jam,\u201d 1 Freddy 1 was 1 saying. 1 \u201cThe 1 jam\u2019s 1 jolly 1 good.\u201d 1 George, 1 looking 1 big 1 and 1 dishevelled, 1 was 1 pacing 1 up 1 and 1 down 1 the 1 dining-room. 1 As 1 she 1 entered 1 he 1 stopped, 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cNo--nothing 1 to 1 eat.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 go 1 down 1 to 1 the 1 others,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy; 1 \u201cCharlotte 1 and 1 I 1 will 1 give 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 all 1 he 1 wants. 1 Where\u2019s 1 mother?\u201d 1 \u201cShe\u2019s 1 started 1 on 1 her 1 Sunday 1 writing. 1 She\u2019s 1 in 1 the 1 drawing-room.\u201d 1 \u201cThat\u2019s 1 all 1 right. 1 You 1 go 1 away.\u201d 1 He 1 went 1 off 1 singing. 1 Lucy 1 sat 1 down 1 at 1 the 1 table. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 was 1 thoroughly 1 frightened, 1 took 1 up 1 a 1 book 1 and 1 pretended 1 to 1 read. 1 She 1 would 1 not 1 be 1 drawn 1 into 1 an 1 elaborate 1 speech. 1 She 1 just 1 said: 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 have 1 it, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 I 1 cannot 1 even 1 talk 1 to 1 you. 1 Go 1 out 1 of 1 this 1 house, 1 and 1 never 1 come 1 into 1 it 1 again 1 as 1 long 1 as 1 I 1 live 1 here--\u201d 1 flushing 1 as 1 she 1 spoke 1 and 1 pointing 1 to 1 the 1 door. 1 \u201cI 1 hate 1 a 1 row. 1 Go 1 please.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat--\u201d 1 \u201cNo 1 discussion.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 I 1 can\u2019t--\u201d 1 She 1 shook 1 her 1 head. 1 \u201cGo, 1 please. 1 I 1 do 1 not 1 want 1 to 1 call 1 in 1 Mr. 1 Vyse.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 don\u2019t 1 mean,\u201d 1 he 1 said, 1 absolutely 1 ignoring 1 Miss 1 Bartlett--\u201cyou 1 don\u2019t 1 mean 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 going 1 to 1 marry 1 that 1 man?\u201d 1 The 1 line 1 was 1 unexpected. 1 She 1 shrugged 1 her 1 shoulders, 1 as 1 if 1 his 1 vulgarity 1 wearied 1 her. 1 \u201cYou 1 are 1 merely 1 ridiculous,\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 quietly. 1 Then 1 his 1 words 1 rose 1 gravely 1 over 1 hers: 1 \u201cYou 1 cannot 1 live 1 with 1 Vyse. 1 He\u2019s 1 only 1 for 1 an 1 acquaintance. 1 He 1 is 1 for 1 society 1 and 1 cultivated 1 talk. 1 He 1 should 1 know 1 no 1 one 1 intimately, 1 least 1 of 1 all 1 a 1 woman.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 new 1 light 1 on 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 character. 1 \u201cHave 1 you 1 ever 1 talked 1 to 1 Vyse 1 without 1 feeling 1 tired?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can 1 scarcely 1 discuss--\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 but 1 have 1 you 1 ever? 1 He 1 is 1 the 1 sort 1 who 1 are 1 all 1 right 1 so 1 long 1 as 1 they 1 keep 1 to 1 things--books, 1 pictures--but 1 kill 1 when 1 they 1 come 1 to 1 people. 1 That\u2019s 1 why 1 I\u2019ll 1 speak 1 out 1 through 1 all 1 this 1 muddle 1 even 1 now. 1 It\u2019s 1 shocking 1 enough 1 to 1 lose 1 you 1 in 1 any 1 case, 1 but 1 generally 1 a 1 man 1 must 1 deny 1 himself 1 joy, 1 and 1 I 1 would 1 have 1 held 1 back 1 if 1 your 1 Cecil 1 had 1 been 1 a 1 different 1 person. 1 I 1 would 1 never 1 have 1 let 1 myself 1 go. 1 But 1 I 1 saw 1 him 1 first 1 in 1 the 1 National 1 Gallery, 1 when 1 he 1 winced 1 because 1 my 1 father 1 mispronounced 1 the 1 names 1 of 1 great 1 painters. 1 Then 1 he 1 brings 1 us 1 here, 1 and 1 we 1 find 1 it 1 is 1 to 1 play 1 some 1 silly 1 trick 1 on 1 a 1 kind 1 neighbour. 1 That 1 is 1 the 1 man 1 all 1 over--playing 1 tricks 1 on 1 people, 1 on 1 the 1 most 1 sacred 1 form 1 of 1 life 1 that 1 he 1 can 1 find. 1 Next, 1 I 1 meet 1 you 1 together, 1 and 1 find 1 him 1 protecting 1 and 1 teaching 1 you 1 and 1 your 1 mother 1 to 1 be 1 shocked, 1 when 1 it 1 was 1 for 1 YOU 1 to 1 settle 1 whether 1 you 1 were 1 shocked 1 or 1 no. 1 Cecil 1 all 1 over 1 again. 1 He 1 daren\u2019t 1 let 1 a 1 woman 1 decide. 1 He\u2019s 1 the 1 type 1 who\u2019s 1 kept 1 Europe 1 back 1 for 1 a 1 thousand 1 years. 1 Every 1 moment 1 of 1 his 1 life 1 he\u2019s 1 forming 1 you, 1 telling 1 you 1 what\u2019s 1 charming 1 or 1 amusing 1 or 1 ladylike, 1 telling 1 you 1 what 1 a 1 man 1 thinks 1 womanly; 1 and 1 you, 1 you 1 of 1 all 1 women, 1 listen 1 to 1 his 1 voice 1 instead 1 of 1 to 1 your 1 own. 1 So 1 it 1 was 1 at 1 the 1 Rectory, 1 when 1 I 1 met 1 you 1 both 1 again; 1 so 1 it 1 has 1 been 1 the 1 whole 1 of 1 this 1 afternoon. 1 Therefore--not 1 \u2018therefore 1 I 1 kissed 1 you,\u2019 1 because 1 the 1 book 1 made 1 me 1 do 1 that, 1 and 1 I 1 wish 1 to 1 goodness 1 I 1 had 1 more 1 self-control. 1 I\u2019m 1 not 1 ashamed. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 apologize. 1 But 1 it 1 has 1 frightened 1 you, 1 and 1 you 1 may 1 not 1 have 1 noticed 1 that 1 I 1 love 1 you. 1 Or 1 would 1 you 1 have 1 told 1 me 1 to 1 go, 1 and 1 dealt 1 with 1 a 1 tremendous 1 thing 1 so 1 lightly? 1 But 1 therefore--therefore 1 I 1 settled 1 to 1 fight 1 him.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 thought 1 of 1 a 1 very 1 good 1 remark. 1 \u201cYou 1 say 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 wants 1 me 1 to 1 listen 1 to 1 him, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 Pardon 1 me 1 for 1 suggesting 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 caught 1 the 1 habit.\u201d 1 And 1 he 1 took 1 the 1 shoddy 1 reproof 1 and 1 touched 1 it 1 into 1 immortality. 1 He 1 said: 1 \u201cYes, 1 I 1 have,\u201d 1 and 1 sank 1 down 1 as 1 if 1 suddenly 1 weary. 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 the 1 same 1 kind 1 of 1 brute 1 at 1 bottom. 1 This 1 desire 1 to 1 govern 1 a 1 woman--it 1 lies 1 very 1 deep, 1 and 1 men 1 and 1 women 1 must 1 fight 1 it 1 together 1 before 1 they 1 shall 1 enter 1 the 1 garden. 1 But 1 I 1 do 1 love 1 you 1 surely 1 in 1 a 1 better 1 way 1 than 1 he 1 does.\u201d 1 He 1 thought. 1 \u201cYes--really 1 in 1 a 1 better 1 way. 1 I 1 want 1 you 1 to 1 have 1 your 1 own 1 thoughts 1 even 1 when 1 I 1 hold 1 you 1 in 1 my 1 arms.\u201d 1 He 1 stretched 1 them 1 towards 1 her. 1 \u201cLucy, 1 be 1 quick--there\u2019s 1 no 1 time 1 for 1 us 1 to 1 talk 1 now--come 1 to 1 me 1 as 1 you 1 came 1 in 1 the 1 spring, 1 and 1 afterwards 1 I 1 will 1 be 1 gentle 1 and 1 explain. 1 I 1 have 1 cared 1 for 1 you 1 since 1 that 1 man 1 died. 1 I 1 cannot 1 live 1 without 1 you, 1 \u2018No 1 good,\u2019 1 I 1 thought; 1 \u2018she 1 is 1 marrying 1 someone 1 else\u2019; 1 but 1 I 1 meet 1 you 1 again 1 when 1 all 1 the 1 world 1 is 1 glorious 1 water 1 and 1 sun. 1 As 1 you 1 came 1 through 1 the 1 wood 1 I 1 saw 1 that 1 nothing 1 else 1 mattered. 1 I 1 called. 1 I 1 wanted 1 to 1 live 1 and 1 have 1 my 1 chance 1 of 1 joy.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 Mr. 1 Vyse?\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 kept 1 commendably 1 calm. 1 \u201cDoes 1 he 1 not 1 matter? 1 That 1 I 1 love 1 Cecil 1 and 1 shall 1 be 1 his 1 wife 1 shortly? 1 A 1 detail 1 of 1 no 1 importance, 1 I 1 suppose?\u201d 1 But 1 he 1 stretched 1 his 1 arms 1 over 1 the 1 table 1 towards 1 her. 1 \u201cMay 1 I 1 ask 1 what 1 you 1 intend 1 to 1 gain 1 by 1 this 1 exhibition?\u201d 1 He 1 said: 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 our 1 last 1 chance. 1 I 1 shall 1 do 1 all 1 that 1 I 1 can.\u201d 1 And 1 as 1 if 1 he 1 had 1 done 1 all 1 else, 1 he 1 turned 1 to 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 sat 1 like 1 some 1 portent 1 against 1 the 1 skies 1 of 1 the 1 evening. 1 \u201cYou 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 stop 1 us 1 this 1 second 1 time 1 if 1 you 1 understood,\u201d 1 he 1 said. 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 been 1 into 1 the 1 dark, 1 and 1 I 1 am 1 going 1 back 1 into 1 it, 1 unless 1 you 1 will 1 try 1 to 1 understand.\u201d 1 Her 1 long, 1 narrow 1 head 1 drove 1 backwards 1 and 1 forwards, 1 as 1 though 1 demolishing 1 some 1 invisible 1 obstacle. 1 She 1 did 1 not 1 answer. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 being 1 young,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 quietly, 1 picking 1 up 1 his 1 racquet 1 from 1 the 1 floor 1 and 1 preparing 1 to 1 go. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 being 1 certain 1 that 1 Lucy 1 cares 1 for 1 me 1 really. 1 It 1 is 1 that 1 love 1 and 1 youth 1 matter 1 intellectually.\u201d 1 In 1 silence 1 the 1 two 1 women 1 watched 1 him. 1 His 1 last 1 remark, 1 they 1 knew, 1 was 1 nonsense, 1 but 1 was 1 he 1 going 1 after 1 it 1 or 1 not? 1 Would 1 not 1 he, 1 the 1 cad, 1 the 1 charlatan, 1 attempt 1 a 1 more 1 dramatic 1 finish? 1 No. 1 He 1 was 1 apparently 1 content. 1 He 1 left 1 them, 1 carefully 1 closing 1 the 1 front 1 door; 1 and 1 when 1 they 1 looked 1 through 1 the 1 hall 1 window, 1 they 1 saw 1 him 1 go 1 up 1 the 1 drive 1 and 1 begin 1 to 1 climb 1 the 1 slopes 1 of 1 withered 1 fern 1 behind 1 the 1 house. 1 Their 1 tongues 1 were 1 loosed, 1 and 1 they 1 burst 1 into 1 stealthy 1 rejoicings. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Lucia--come 1 back 1 here--oh, 1 what 1 an 1 awful 1 man!\u201d 1 Lucy 1 had 1 no 1 reaction--at 1 least, 1 not 1 yet. 1 \u201cWell, 1 he 1 amuses 1 me,\u201d 1 she 1 said. 1 \u201cEither 1 I\u2019m 1 mad, 1 or 1 else 1 he 1 is, 1 and 1 I\u2019m 1 inclined 1 to 1 think 1 it\u2019s 1 the 1 latter. 1 One 1 more 1 fuss 1 through 1 with 1 you, 1 Charlotte. 1 Many 1 thanks. 1 I 1 think, 1 though, 1 that 1 this 1 is 1 the 1 last. 1 My 1 admirer 1 will 1 hardly 1 trouble 1 me 1 again.\u201d 1 And 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 too, 1 essayed 1 the 1 roguish: 1 \u201cWell, 1 it 1 isn\u2019t 1 everyone 1 who 1 could 1 boast 1 such 1 a 1 conquest, 1 dearest, 1 is 1 it? 1 Oh, 1 one 1 oughtn\u2019t 1 to 1 laugh, 1 really. 1 It 1 might 1 have 1 been 1 very 1 serious. 1 But 1 you 1 were 1 so 1 sensible 1 and 1 brave--so 1 unlike 1 the 1 girls 1 of 1 my 1 day.\u201d 1 \u201cLet\u2019s 1 go 1 down 1 to 1 them.\u201d 1 But, 1 once 1 in 1 the 1 open 1 air, 1 she 1 paused. 1 Some 1 emotion--pity, 1 terror, 1 love, 1 but 1 the 1 emotion 1 was 1 strong--seized 1 her, 1 and 1 she 1 was 1 aware 1 of 1 autumn. 1 Summer 1 was 1 ending, 1 and 1 the 1 evening 1 brought 1 her 1 odours 1 of 1 decay, 1 the 1 more 1 pathetic 1 because 1 they 1 were 1 reminiscent 1 of 1 spring. 1 That 1 something 1 or 1 other 1 mattered 1 intellectually? 1 A 1 leaf, 1 violently 1 agitated, 1 danced 1 past 1 her, 1 while 1 other 1 leaves 1 lay 1 motionless. 1 That 1 the 1 earth 1 was 1 hastening 1 to 1 re-enter 1 darkness, 1 and 1 the 1 shadows 1 of 1 those 1 trees 1 over 1 Windy 1 Corner? 1 \u201cHullo, 1 Lucy! 1 There\u2019s 1 still 1 light 1 enough 1 for 1 another 1 set, 1 if 1 you 1 two\u2019ll 1 hurry.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson 1 has 1 had 1 to 1 go.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 a 1 nuisance! 1 That 1 spoils 1 the 1 four. 1 I 1 say, 1 Cecil, 1 do 1 play, 1 do, 1 there\u2019s 1 a 1 good 1 chap. 1 It\u2019s 1 Floyd\u2019s 1 last 1 day. 1 Do 1 play 1 tennis 1 with 1 us, 1 just 1 this 1 once.\u201d 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 voice 1 came: 1 \u201cMy 1 dear 1 Freddy, 1 I 1 am 1 no 1 athlete. 1 As 1 you 1 well 1 remarked 1 this 1 very 1 morning, 1 \u2018There 1 are 1 some 1 chaps 1 who 1 are 1 no 1 good 1 for 1 anything 1 but 1 books\u2019; 1 I 1 plead 1 guilty 1 to 1 being 1 such 1 a 1 chap, 1 and 1 will 1 not 1 inflict 1 myself 1 on 1 you.\u201d 1 The 1 scales 1 fell 1 from 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 eyes. 1 How 1 had 1 she 1 stood 1 Cecil 1 for 1 a 1 moment? 1 He 1 was 1 absolutely 1 intolerable, 1 and 1 the 1 same 1 evening 1 she 1 broke 1 off 1 her 1 engagement. 1 Chapter 1 XVII: 1 Lying 1 to 1 Cecil 1 He 1 was 1 bewildered. 1 He 1 had 1 nothing 1 to 1 say. 1 He 1 was 1 not 1 even 1 angry, 1 but 1 stood, 1 with 1 a 1 glass 1 of 1 whiskey 1 between 1 his 1 hands, 1 trying 1 to 1 think 1 what 1 had 1 led 1 her 1 to 1 such 1 a 1 conclusion. 1 She 1 had 1 chosen 1 the 1 moment 1 before 1 bed, 1 when, 1 in 1 accordance 1 with 1 their 1 bourgeois 1 habit, 1 she 1 always 1 dispensed 1 drinks 1 to 1 the 1 men. 1 Freddy 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Floyd 1 were 1 sure 1 to 1 retire 1 with 1 their 1 glasses, 1 while 1 Cecil 1 invariably 1 lingered, 1 sipping 1 at 1 his 1 while 1 she 1 locked 1 up 1 the 1 sideboard. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 very 1 sorry 1 about 1 it,\u201d 1 she 1 said; 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 carefully 1 thought 1 things 1 over. 1 We 1 are 1 too 1 different. 1 I 1 must 1 ask 1 you 1 to 1 release 1 me, 1 and 1 try 1 to 1 forget 1 that 1 there 1 ever 1 was 1 such 1 a 1 foolish 1 girl.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 suitable 1 speech, 1 but 1 she 1 was 1 more 1 angry 1 than 1 sorry, 1 and 1 her 1 voice 1 showed 1 it. 1 \u201cDifferent--how--how--\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 haven\u2019t 1 had 1 a 1 really 1 good 1 education, 1 for 1 one 1 thing,\u201d 1 she 1 continued, 1 still 1 on 1 her 1 knees 1 by 1 the 1 sideboard. 1 \u201cMy 1 Italian 1 trip 1 came 1 too 1 late, 1 and 1 I 1 am 1 forgetting 1 all 1 that 1 I 1 learnt 1 there. 1 I 1 shall 1 never 1 be 1 able 1 to 1 talk 1 to 1 your 1 friends, 1 or 1 behave 1 as 1 a 1 wife 1 of 1 yours 1 should.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 understand 1 you. 1 You 1 aren\u2019t 1 like 1 ten 1 minutes 1 more. 1 \u201cCertainly,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 hostess 1 wearily. 1 \u201cI 1 forgot 1 it 1 was 1 Friday. 1 Let\u2019s 1 all 1 go. 1 Powell 1 can 1 go 1 round 1 to 1 the 1 stables.\u201d 1 \u201cLucy 1 dearest--\u201d 1 \u201cNo 1 church 1 for 1 me, 1 thank 1 you.\u201d 1 A 1 sigh, 1 and 1 they 1 departed. 1 The 1 church 1 was 1 invisible, 1 but 1 up 1 in 1 the 1 darkness 1 to 1 the 1 left 1 there 1 was 1 a 1 hint 1 of 1 colour. 1 This 1 was 1 a 1 stained 1 window, 1 through 1 which 1 some 1 feeble 1 light 1 was 1 shining, 1 and 1 when 1 the 1 door 1 opened 1 Lucy 1 heard 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 voice 1 running 1 through 1 the 1 litany 1 to 1 a 1 minute 1 congregation. 1 Even 1 their 1 church, 1 built 1 upon 1 the 1 slope 1 of 1 the 1 hill 1 so 1 artfully, 1 with 1 its 1 beautiful 1 raised 1 transept 1 and 1 its 1 spire 1 of 1 silvery 1 shingle--even 1 their 1 church 1 had 1 lost 1 its 1 charm; 1 and 1 the 1 thing 1 one 1 never 1 talked 1 about--religion--was 1 fading 1 like 1 all 1 the 1 other 1 things. 1 She 1 followed 1 the 1 maid 1 into 1 the 1 Rectory. 1 Would 1 she 1 object 1 to 1 sitting 1 in 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 study? 1 There 1 was 1 only 1 that 1 one 1 fire. 1 She 1 would 1 not 1 object. 1 Some 1 one 1 was 1 there 1 already, 1 for 1 Lucy 1 heard 1 the 1 words: 1 \u201cA 1 lady 1 to 1 wait, 1 sir.\u201d 1 Old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 sitting 1 by 1 the 1 fire, 1 with 1 his 1 foot 1 upon 1 a 1 gout-stool. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 that 1 you 1 should 1 come!\u201d 1 he 1 quavered; 1 and 1 Lucy 1 saw 1 an 1 alteration 1 in 1 him 1 since 1 last 1 Sunday. 1 Not 1 a 1 word 1 would 1 come 1 to 1 her 1 lips. 1 George 1 she 1 had 1 faced, 1 and 1 could 1 have 1 faced 1 again, 1 but 1 she 1 had 1 forgotten 1 how 1 to 1 treat 1 his 1 father. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch, 1 dear, 1 we 1 are 1 so 1 sorry! 1 George 1 is 1 so 1 sorry! 1 He 1 thought 1 he 1 had 1 a 1 right 1 to 1 try. 1 I 1 cannot 1 blame 1 my 1 boy, 1 and 1 yet 1 I 1 wish 1 he 1 had 1 told 1 me 1 first. 1 He 1 ought 1 not 1 to 1 have 1 tried. 1 I 1 knew 1 nothing 1 about 1 it 1 at 1 all.\u201d 1 If 1 only 1 she 1 could 1 remember 1 how 1 to 1 behave! 1 He 1 held 1 up 1 his 1 hand. 1 \u201cBut 1 you 1 must 1 not 1 scold 1 him.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 turned 1 her 1 back, 1 and 1 began 1 to 1 look 1 at 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 books. 1 \u201cI 1 taught 1 him,\u201d 1 he 1 quavered, 1 \u201cto 1 trust 1 in 1 love. 1 I 1 said: 1 \u2018When 1 love 1 comes, 1 that 1 is 1 reality.\u2019 1 I 1 said: 1 \u2018Passion 1 does 1 not 1 blind. 1 No. 1 Passion 1 is 1 sanity, 1 and 1 the 1 woman 1 you 1 love, 1 she 1 is 1 the 1 only 1 person 1 you 1 will 1 ever 1 really 1 understand.\u2019\u201d 1 He 1 sighed: 1 \u201cTrue, 1 everlastingly 1 true, 1 though 1 my 1 day 1 is 1 over, 1 and 1 though 1 there 1 is 1 the 1 result. 1 Poor 1 boy! 1 He 1 is 1 so 1 sorry! 1 He 1 said 1 he 1 knew 1 it 1 was 1 madness 1 when 1 you 1 brought 1 your 1 cousin 1 in; 1 that 1 whatever 1 you 1 felt 1 you 1 did 1 not 1 mean. 1 Yet\u201d--his 1 voice 1 gathered 1 strength: 1 he 1 spoke 1 out 1 to 1 make 1 certain--\u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch, 1 do 1 you 1 remember 1 Italy?\u201d 1 Lucy 1 selected 1 a 1 book--a 1 volume 1 of 1 Old 1 Testament 1 commentaries. 1 Holding 1 it 1 up 1 to 1 her 1 eyes, 1 she 1 said: 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 no 1 wish 1 to 1 discuss 1 Italy 1 or 1 any 1 subject 1 connected 1 with 1 your 1 son.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 you 1 do 1 remember 1 it?\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 has 1 misbehaved 1 himself 1 from 1 the 1 first.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 only 1 was 1 told 1 that 1 he 1 loved 1 you 1 last 1 Sunday. 1 I 1 never 1 could 1 judge 1 behaviour. 1 I--I--suppose 1 he 1 has.\u201d 1 Feeling 1 a 1 little 1 steadier, 1 she 1 put 1 the 1 book 1 back 1 and 1 turned 1 round 1 to 1 him. 1 His 1 face 1 was 1 drooping 1 and 1 swollen, 1 but 1 his 1 eyes, 1 though 1 they 1 were 1 sunken 1 deep, 1 gleamed 1 with 1 a 1 child\u2019s 1 courage. 1 \u201cWhy, 1 he 1 has 1 behaved 1 abominably,\u201d 1 she 1 said. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 glad 1 he 1 is 1 sorry. 1 Do 1 you 1 know 1 what 1 he 1 did?\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 \u2018abominably,\u2019\u201d 1 was 1 the 1 gentle 1 correction. 1 \u201cHe 1 only 1 tried 1 when 1 he 1 should 1 not 1 have 1 tried. 1 You 1 have 1 all 1 you 1 want, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch: 1 you 1 are 1 going 1 to 1 marry 1 the 1 man 1 you 1 love. 1 Do 1 not 1 go 1 out 1 of 1 George\u2019s 1 life 1 saying 1 he 1 is 1 abominable.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 of 1 course,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 ashamed 1 at 1 the 1 reference 1 to 1 Cecil. 1 \u201c\u2018Abominable\u2019 1 is 1 much 1 too 1 strong. 1 I 1 am 1 sorry 1 I 1 used 1 it 1 about 1 your 1 son. 1 I 1 think 1 I 1 will 1 go 1 to 1 church, 1 after 1 all. 1 My 1 mother 1 and 1 my 1 cousin 1 have 1 gone. 1 I 1 shall 1 not 1 be 1 so 1 very 1 late--\u201d 1 \u201cEspecially 1 as 1 he 1 has 1 gone 1 under,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 quietly. 1 \u201cWhat 1 was 1 that?\u201d 1 \u201cGone 1 under 1 naturally.\u201d 1 He 1 beat 1 his 1 palms 1 together 1 in 1 silence; 1 his 1 head 1 fell 1 on 1 his 1 chest. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 understand.\u201d 1 \u201cAs 1 his 1 mother 1 did.\u201d 1 \u201cBut, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson--MR. 1 EMERSON--what 1 are 1 you 1 talking 1 about?\u201d 1 \u201cWhen 1 I 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 have 1 George 1 baptized,\u201d 1 said 1 he. 1 Lucy 1 was 1 frightened. 1 \u201cAnd 1 she 1 agreed 1 that 1 baptism 1 was 1 nothing, 1 but 1 he 1 caught 1 that 1 fever 1 when 1 he 1 was 1 twelve 1 and 1 she 1 turned 1 round. 1 She 1 thought 1 it 1 a 1 judgement.\u201d 1 He 1 shuddered. 1 \u201cOh, 1 horrible, 1 when 1 we 1 had 1 given 1 up 1 that 1 sort 1 of 1 thing 1 and 1 broken 1 away 1 from 1 her 1 parents. 1 Oh, 1 horrible--worst 1 of 1 all--worse 1 than 1 death, 1 when 1 you 1 have 1 made 1 a 1 little 1 clearing 1 in 1 the 1 wilderness, 1 planted 1 your 1 little 1 garden, 1 let 1 in 1 your 1 sunlight, 1 and 1 then 1 the 1 weeds 1 creep 1 in 1 again! 1 A 1 judgement! 1 And 1 our 1 boy 1 had 1 typhoid 1 because 1 no 1 clergyman 1 had 1 dropped 1 water 1 on 1 him 1 in 1 church! 1 Is 1 it 1 possible, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch? 1 Shall 1 we 1 slip 1 back 1 into 1 the 1 darkness 1 for 1 ever?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 know,\u201d 1 gasped 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 understand 1 this 1 sort 1 of 1 thing. 1 I 1 was 1 not 1 meant 1 to 1 understand 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 Mr. 1 Eager--he 1 came 1 when 1 I 1 was 1 out, 1 and 1 acted 1 according 1 to 1 his 1 principles. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 blame 1 him 1 or 1 any 1 one... 1 but 1 by 1 the 1 time 1 George 1 was 1 well 1 she 1 was 1 ill. 1 He 1 made 1 her 1 think 1 about 1 sin, 1 and 1 she 1 went 1 under 1 thinking 1 about 1 it.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 thus 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 had 1 murdered 1 his 1 wife 1 in 1 the 1 sight 1 of 1 God. 1 \u201cOh, 1 how 1 terrible!\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 forgetting 1 her 1 own 1 affairs 1 at 1 last. 1 \u201cHe 1 was 1 not 1 baptized,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 old 1 man. 1 \u201cI 1 did 1 hold 1 firm.\u201d 1 And 1 he 1 looked 1 with 1 unwavering 1 eyes 1 at 1 the 1 rows 1 of 1 books, 1 as 1 if--at 1 what 1 cost!--he 1 had 1 won 1 a 1 victory 1 over 1 them. 1 \u201cMy 1 boy 1 shall 1 go 1 back 1 to 1 the 1 earth 1 untouched.\u201d 1 She 1 asked 1 whether 1 young 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 ill. 1 \u201cOh--last 1 Sunday.\u201d 1 He 1 started 1 into 1 the 1 present. 1 \u201cGeorge 1 last 1 Sunday--no, 1 not 1 ill: 1 just 1 gone 1 under. 1 He 1 is 1 never 1 ill. 1 But 1 he 1 is 1 his 1 mother\u2019s 1 son. 1 Her 1 eyes 1 were 1 his, 1 and 1 she 1 had 1 that 1 forehead 1 that 1 I 1 think 1 so 1 beautiful, 1 and 1 he 1 will 1 not 1 think 1 it 1 worth 1 while 1 to 1 live. 1 It 1 was 1 always 1 touch 1 and 1 go. 1 He 1 will 1 live; 1 but 1 he 1 will 1 not 1 think 1 it 1 worth 1 while 1 to 1 live. 1 He 1 will 1 never 1 think 1 anything 1 worth 1 while. 1 You 1 remember 1 that 1 church 1 at 1 Florence?\u201d 1 Lucy 1 did 1 remember, 1 and 1 how 1 she 1 had 1 suggested 1 that 1 George 1 should 1 collect 1 postage 1 stamps. 1 \u201cAfter 1 you 1 left 1 Florence--horrible. 1 Then 1 we 1 took 1 the 1 house 1 here, 1 and 1 he 1 goes 1 bathing 1 with 1 your 1 brother, 1 and 1 became 1 better. 1 You 1 saw 1 him 1 bathing?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 so 1 sorry, 1 but 1 it 1 is 1 no 1 good 1 discussing 1 this 1 affair. 1 I 1 am 1 deeply 1 sorry 1 about 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 there 1 came 1 something 1 about 1 a 1 novel. 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 follow 1 it 1 at 1 all; 1 I 1 had 1 to 1 hear 1 so 1 much, 1 and 1 he 1 minded 1 telling 1 me; 1 he 1 finds 1 me 1 too 1 old. 1 Ah, 1 well, 1 one 1 must 1 have 1 failures. 1 George 1 comes 1 down 1 to-morrow, 1 and 1 takes 1 me 1 up 1 to 1 his 1 London 1 rooms. 1 He 1 can\u2019t 1 bear 1 to 1 be 1 about 1 here, 1 and 1 I 1 must 1 be 1 where 1 he 1 is.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson,\u201d 1 cried 1 the 1 girl, 1 \u201cdon\u2019t 1 leave 1 at 1 least, 1 not 1 on 1 my 1 account. 1 I 1 am 1 going 1 to 1 Greece. 1 Don\u2019t 1 leave 1 your 1 comfortable 1 house.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 the 1 first 1 time 1 her 1 voice 1 had 1 been 1 kind 1 and 1 he 1 smiled. 1 \u201cHow 1 good 1 everyone 1 is! 1 And 1 look 1 at 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 housing 1 me--came 1 over 1 this 1 morning 1 and 1 heard 1 I 1 was 1 going! 1 Here 1 I 1 am 1 so 1 comfortable 1 with 1 a 1 fire.\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 but 1 you 1 won\u2019t 1 go 1 back 1 to 1 London. 1 It\u2019s 1 absurd.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 must 1 be 1 with 1 George; 1 I 1 must 1 make 1 him 1 care 1 to 1 live, 1 and 1 down 1 here 1 he 1 can\u2019t. 1 He 1 says 1 the 1 thought 1 of 1 seeing 1 you 1 and 1 of 1 hearing 1 about 1 you--I 1 am 1 not 1 justifying 1 him: 1 I 1 am 1 only 1 saying 1 what 1 has 1 happened.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson\u201d--she 1 took 1 hold 1 of 1 his 1 hand--\u201cyou 1 mustn\u2019t. 1 I\u2019ve 1 been 1 bother 1 enough 1 to 1 the 1 world 1 by 1 now. 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 have 1 you 1 moving 1 out 1 of 1 your 1 house 1 when 1 you 1 like 1 it, 1 and 1 perhaps 1 losing 1 money 1 through 1 it--all 1 on 1 my 1 account. 1 You 1 must 1 stop! 1 I 1 am 1 just 1 going 1 to 1 Greece.\u201d 1 \u201cAll 1 the 1 way 1 to 1 Greece?\u201d 1 Her 1 manner 1 altered. 1 \u201cTo 1 Greece?\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 you 1 must 1 stop. 1 You 1 won\u2019t 1 talk 1 about 1 this 1 business, 1 I 1 know. 1 I 1 can 1 trust 1 you 1 both.\u201d 1 \u201cCertainly 1 you 1 can. 1 We 1 either 1 have 1 you 1 in 1 our 1 lives, 1 or 1 leave 1 you 1 to 1 the 1 life 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 chosen.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 want--\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 suppose 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 is 1 very 1 angry 1 with 1 George? 1 No, 1 it 1 was 1 wrong 1 of 1 George 1 to 1 try. 1 We 1 have 1 pushed 1 our 1 beliefs 1 too 1 far. 1 I 1 fancy 1 that 1 we 1 deserve 1 sorrow.\u201d 1 She 1 looked 1 at 1 the 1 books 1 again--black, 1 brown, 1 and 1 that 1 acrid 1 theological 1 blue. 1 They 1 surrounded 1 the 1 visitors 1 on 1 every 1 side; 1 they 1 were 1 piled 1 on 1 the 1 tables, 1 they 1 pressed 1 against 1 the 1 very 1 ceiling. 1 To 1 Lucy 1 who 1 could 1 not 1 see 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 was 1 profoundly 1 religious, 1 and 1 differed 1 from 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 chiefly 1 by 1 his 1 acknowledgment 1 of 1 passion--it 1 seemed 1 dreadful 1 that 1 the 1 old 1 man 1 should 1 crawl 1 into 1 such 1 a 1 sanctum, 1 when 1 he 1 was 1 unhappy, 1 and 1 be 1 dependent 1 on 1 the 1 bounty 1 of 1 a 1 clergyman. 1 More 1 certain 1 than 1 ever 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 tired, 1 he 1 offered 1 her 1 his 1 chair. 1 \u201cNo, 1 please 1 sit 1 still. 1 I 1 think 1 I 1 will 1 sit 1 in 1 the 1 carriage.\u201d 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch, 1 you 1 do 1 sound 1 tired.\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 a 1 bit,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 with 1 trembling 1 lips. 1 \u201cBut 1 you 1 are, 1 and 1 there\u2019s 1 a 1 look 1 of 1 George 1 about 1 you. 1 And 1 what 1 were 1 you 1 saying 1 about 1 going 1 abroad?\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 silent. 1 \u201cGreece\u201d--and 1 she 1 saw 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 thinking 1 the 1 word 1 over--\u201cGreece; 1 but 1 you 1 were 1 to 1 be 1 married 1 this 1 year, 1 I 1 thought.\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 till 1 January, 1 it 1 wasn\u2019t,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 clasping 1 her 1 hands. 1 Would 1 she 1 tell 1 an 1 actual 1 lie 1 when 1 it 1 came 1 to 1 the 1 point? 1 \u201cI 1 suppose 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 is 1 going 1 with 1 you. 1 I 1 hope--it 1 isn\u2019t 1 because 1 George 1 spoke 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 both 1 going?\u201d 1 \u201cNo.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 hope 1 that 1 you 1 will 1 enjoy 1 Greece 1 with 1 Mr. 1 Vyse.\u201d 1 \u201cThank 1 you.\u201d 1 At 1 that 1 moment 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 came 1 back 1 from 1 church. 1 His 1 cassock 1 was 1 covered 1 with 1 rain. 1 \u201cThat\u2019s 1 all 1 right,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 kindly. 1 \u201cI 1 counted 1 on 1 you 1 two 1 keeping 1 each 1 other 1 company. 1 It\u2019s 1 pouring 1 again. 1 The 1 entire 1 congregation, 1 which 1 consists 1 of 1 your 1 cousin, 1 your 1 mother, 1 and 1 my 1 mother, 1 stands 1 waiting 1 in 1 the 1 church, 1 till 1 the 1 carriage 1 fetches 1 it. 1 Did 1 Powell 1 go 1 round?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 so; 1 I\u2019ll 1 see.\u201d 1 \u201cNo--of 1 course, 1 I\u2019ll 1 see. 1 How 1 are 1 the 1 Miss 1 Alans?\u201d 1 \u201cVery 1 well, 1 thank 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cDid 1 you 1 tell 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 about 1 Greece?\u201d 1 \u201cI--I 1 did.\u201d 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 you 1 think 1 it 1 very 1 plucky 1 of 1 her, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 to 1 undertake 1 the 1 two 1 Miss 1 Alans? 1 Now, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 go 1 back--keep 1 warm. 1 I 1 think 1 three 1 is 1 such 1 a 1 courageous 1 number 1 to 1 go 1 travelling.\u201d 1 And 1 he 1 hurried 1 off 1 to 1 the 1 stables. 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 not 1 going,\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 hoarsely. 1 \u201cI 1 made 1 a 1 slip. 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 does 1 stop 1 behind 1 in 1 England.\u201d 1 Somehow 1 it 1 was 1 impossible 1 to 1 cheat 1 this 1 old 1 man. 1 To 1 George, 1 to 1 Cecil, 1 she 1 would 1 have 1 lied 1 again; 1 but 1 he 1 seemed 1 so 1 near 1 the 1 end 1 of 1 things, 1 so 1 dignified 1 in 1 his 1 approach 1 to 1 the 1 gulf, 1 of 1 which 1 he 1 gave 1 one 1 account, 1 and 1 the 1", "0", "53837"], "mapper-5-count-output": ["hobby? 1 Why, 1 I 1 myself 1 have 1 worries, 1 but 1 I 1 can 1 generally 1 forget 1 them 1 at 1 the 1 piano; 1 and 1 collecting 1 stamps 1 did 1 no 1 end 1 of 1 good 1 for 1 my 1 brother. 1 Perhaps 1 Italy 1 bores 1 him; 1 you 1 ought 1 to 1 try 1 the 1 Alps 1 or 1 the 1 Lakes.\u201d 1 The 1 old 1 man\u2019s 1 face 1 saddened, 1 and 1 he 1 touched 1 her 1 gently 1 with 1 his 1 hand. 1 This 1 did 1 not 1 alarm 1 her; 1 she 1 thought 1 that 1 her 1 advice 1 had 1 impressed 1 him 1 and 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 thanking 1 her 1 for 1 it. 1 Indeed, 1 he 1 no 1 longer 1 alarmed 1 her 1 at 1 all; 1 she 1 regarded 1 him 1 as 1 a 1 kind 1 thing, 1 but 1 quite 1 silly. 1 Her 1 feelings 1 were 1 as 1 inflated 1 spiritually 1 as 1 they 1 had 1 been 1 an 1 hour 1 ago 1 esthetically, 1 before 1 she 1 lost 1 Baedeker. 1 The 1 dear 1 George, 1 now 1 striding 1 towards 1 them 1 over 1 the 1 tombstones, 1 seemed 1 both 1 pitiable 1 and 1 absurd. 1 He 1 approached, 1 his 1 face 1 in 1 the 1 shadow. 1 He 1 said: 1 \u201cMiss 1 Bartlett.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 good 1 gracious 1 me!\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 suddenly 1 collapsing 1 and 1 again 1 seeing 1 the 1 whole 1 of 1 life 1 in 1 a 1 new 1 perspective. 1 \u201cWhere? 1 Where?\u201d 1 \u201cIn 1 the 1 nave.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 see. 1 Those 1 gossiping 1 little 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 must 1 have--\u201d 1 She 1 checked 1 herself. 1 \u201cPoor 1 girl!\u201d 1 exploded 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 \u201cPoor 1 girl!\u201d 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 let 1 this 1 pass, 1 for 1 it 1 was 1 just 1 what 1 she 1 was 1 feeling 1 herself. 1 \u201cPoor 1 girl? 1 I 1 fail 1 to 1 understand 1 the 1 point 1 of 1 that 1 remark. 1 I 1 think 1 myself 1 a 1 very 1 fortunate 1 girl, 1 I 1 assure 1 you. 1 I\u2019m 1 thoroughly 1 happy, 1 and 1 having 1 a 1 splendid 1 time. 1 Pray 1 don\u2019t 1 waste 1 time 1 mourning 1 over 1 me. 1 There\u2019s 1 enough 1 sorrow 1 in 1 the 1 world, 1 isn\u2019t 1 there, 1 without 1 trying 1 to 1 invent 1 it. 1 Good-bye. 1 Thank 1 you 1 both 1 so 1 much 1 for 1 all 1 your 1 kindness. 1 Ah, 1 yes! 1 there 1 does 1 come 1 my 1 cousin. 1 A 1 delightful 1 morning! 1 Santa 1 Croce 1 is 1 a 1 wonderful 1 church.\u201d 1 She 1 joined 1 her 1 cousin. 1 Chapter 1 III: 1 Music, 1 Violets, 1 and 1 the 1 Letter 1 \u201cS\u201d 1 It 1 so 1 happened 1 that 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 found 1 daily 1 life 1 rather 1 chaotic, 1 entered 1 a 1 more 1 solid 1 world 1 when 1 she 1 opened 1 the 1 piano. 1 She 1 was 1 then 1 no 1 longer 1 either 1 deferential 1 or 1 patronizing; 1 no 1 longer 1 either 1 a 1 rebel 1 or 1 a 1 slave. 1 The 1 kingdom 1 of 1 music 1 is 1 not 1 the 1 kingdom 1 of 1 this 1 world; 1 it 1 will 1 accept 1 those 1 whom 1 breeding 1 and 1 intellect 1 and 1 culture 1 have 1 alike 1 rejected. 1 The 1 commonplace 1 person 1 begins 1 to 1 play, 1 and 1 shoots 1 into 1 the 1 empyrean 1 without 1 effort, 1 whilst 1 we 1 look 1 up, 1 marvelling 1 how 1 he 1 has 1 escaped 1 us, 1 and 1 thinking 1 how 1 we 1 could 1 worship 1 him 1 and 1 love 1 him, 1 would 1 he 1 but 1 translate 1 his 1 visions 1 into 1 human 1 words, 1 and 1 his 1 experiences 1 into 1 human 1 actions. 1 Perhaps 1 he 1 cannot; 1 certainly 1 he 1 does 1 not, 1 or 1 does 1 so 1 very 1 seldom. 1 Lucy 1 had 1 done 1 so 1 never. 1 She 1 was 1 no 1 dazzling 1 executante; 1 her 1 runs 1 were 1 not 1 at 1 all 1 like 1 strings 1 of 1 pearls, 1 and 1 she 1 struck 1 no 1 more 1 right 1 notes 1 than 1 was 1 suitable 1 for 1 one 1 of 1 her 1 age 1 and 1 situation. 1 Nor 1 was 1 she 1 the 1 passionate 1 young 1 lady, 1 who 1 performs 1 so 1 tragically 1 on 1 a 1 summer\u2019s 1 evening 1 with 1 the 1 window 1 open. 1 Passion 1 was 1 there, 1 but 1 it 1 could 1 not 1 be 1 easily 1 labelled; 1 it 1 slipped 1 between 1 love 1 and 1 hatred 1 and 1 jealousy, 1 and 1 all 1 the 1 furniture 1 of 1 the 1 pictorial 1 style. 1 And 1 she 1 was 1 tragical 1 only 1 in 1 the 1 sense 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 great, 1 for 1 she 1 loved 1 to 1 play 1 on 1 the 1 side 1 of 1 Victory. 1 Victory 1 of 1 what 1 and 1 over 1 what--that 1 is 1 more 1 than 1 the 1 words 1 of 1 daily 1 life 1 can 1 tell 1 us. 1 But 1 that 1 some 1 sonatas 1 of 1 Beethoven 1 are 1 written 1 tragic 1 no 1 one 1 can 1 gainsay; 1 yet 1 they 1 can 1 triumph 1 or 1 despair 1 as 1 the 1 player 1 decides, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 had 1 decided 1 that 1 they 1 should 1 triumph. 1 A 1 very 1 wet 1 afternoon 1 at 1 the 1 Bertolini 1 permitted 1 her 1 to 1 do 1 the 1 thing 1 she 1 really 1 liked, 1 and 1 after 1 lunch 1 she 1 opened 1 the 1 little 1 draped 1 piano. 1 A 1 few 1 people 1 lingered 1 round 1 and 1 praised 1 her 1 playing, 1 but 1 finding 1 that 1 she 1 made 1 no 1 reply, 1 dispersed 1 to 1 their 1 rooms 1 to 1 write 1 up 1 their 1 diaries 1 or 1 to 1 sleep. 1 She 1 took 1 no 1 notice 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 looking 1 for 1 his 1 son, 1 nor 1 of 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 looking 1 for 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 nor 1 of 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 looking 1 for 1 her 1 cigarette-case. 1 Like 1 every 1 true 1 performer, 1 she 1 was 1 intoxicated 1 by 1 the 1 mere 1 feel 1 of 1 the 1 notes: 1 they 1 were 1 fingers 1 caressing 1 her 1 own; 1 and 1 by 1 touch, 1 not 1 by 1 sound 1 alone, 1 did 1 she 1 come 1 to 1 her 1 desire. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 sitting 1 unnoticed 1 in 1 the 1 window, 1 pondered 1 this 1 illogical 1 element 1 in 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 and 1 recalled 1 the 1 occasion 1 at 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells 1 when 1 he 1 had 1 discovered 1 it. 1 It 1 was 1 at 1 one 1 of 1 those 1 entertainments 1 where 1 the 1 upper 1 classes 1 entertain 1 the 1 lower. 1 The 1 seats 1 were 1 filled 1 with 1 a 1 respectful 1 audience, 1 and 1 the 1 ladies 1 and 1 gentlemen 1 of 1 the 1 parish, 1 under 1 the 1 auspices 1 of 1 their 1 vicar, 1 sang, 1 or 1 recited, 1 or 1 imitated 1 the 1 drawing 1 of 1 a 1 champagne 1 cork. 1 Among 1 the 1 promised 1 items 1 was 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch. 1 Piano. 1 Beethoven,\u201d 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 wondering 1 whether 1 it 1 would 1 be 1 Adelaida, 1 or 1 the 1 march 1 of 1 The 1 Ruins 1 of 1 Athens, 1 when 1 his 1 composure 1 was 1 disturbed 1 by 1 the 1 opening 1 bars 1 of 1 Opus 1 III. 1 He 1 was 1 in 1 suspense 1 all 1 through 1 the 1 introduction, 1 for 1 not 1 until 1 the 1 pace 1 quickens 1 does 1 one 1 know 1 what 1 the 1 performer 1 intends. 1 With 1 the 1 roar 1 of 1 the 1 opening 1 theme 1 he 1 knew 1 that 1 things 1 were 1 going 1 extraordinarily; 1 in 1 the 1 chords 1 that 1 herald 1 the 1 conclusion 1 he 1 heard 1 the 1 hammer 1 strokes 1 of 1 victory. 1 He 1 was 1 glad 1 that 1 she 1 only 1 played 1 the 1 first 1 movement, 1 for 1 he 1 could 1 have 1 paid 1 no 1 attention 1 to 1 the 1 winding 1 intricacies 1 of 1 the 1 measures 1 of 1 nine-sixteen. 1 The 1 audience 1 clapped, 1 no 1 less 1 respectful. 1 It 1 was 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 who 1 started 1 the 1 stamping; 1 it 1 was 1 all 1 that 1 one 1 could 1 do. 1 \u201cWho 1 is 1 she?\u201d 1 he 1 asked 1 the 1 vicar 1 afterwards. 1 \u201cCousin 1 of 1 one 1 of 1 my 1 parishioners. 1 I 1 do 1 not 1 consider 1 her 1 choice 1 of 1 a 1 piece 1 happy. 1 Beethoven 1 is 1 so 1 usually 1 simple 1 and 1 direct 1 in 1 his 1 appeal 1 that 1 it 1 is 1 sheer 1 perversity 1 to 1 choose 1 a 1 thing 1 like 1 that, 1 which, 1 if 1 anything, 1 disturbs.\u201d 1 \u201cIntroduce 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cShe 1 will 1 be 1 delighted. 1 She 1 and 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 are 1 full 1 of 1 the 1 praises 1 of 1 your 1 sermon.\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 sermon?\u201d 1 cried 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cWhy 1 ever 1 did 1 she 1 listen 1 to 1 it?\u201d 1 When 1 he 1 was 1 introduced 1 he 1 understood 1 why, 1 for 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 disjoined 1 from 1 her 1 music 1 stool, 1 was 1 only 1 a 1 young 1 lady 1 with 1 a 1 quantity 1 of 1 dark 1 hair 1 and 1 a 1 very 1 pretty, 1 pale, 1 undeveloped 1 face. 1 She 1 loved 1 going 1 to 1 concerts, 1 she 1 loved 1 stopping 1 with 1 her 1 cousin, 1 she 1 loved 1 iced 1 coffee 1 and 1 meringues. 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 doubt 1 that 1 she 1 loved 1 his 1 sermon 1 also. 1 But 1 before 1 he 1 left 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells 1 he 1 made 1 a 1 remark 1 to 1 the 1 vicar, 1 which 1 he 1 now 1 made 1 to 1 Lucy 1 herself 1 when 1 she 1 closed 1 the 1 little 1 piano 1 and 1 moved 1 dreamily 1 towards 1 him: 1 \u201cIf 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 ever 1 takes 1 to 1 live 1 as 1 she 1 plays, 1 it 1 will 1 be 1 very 1 exciting 1 both 1 for 1 us 1 and 1 for 1 her.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 at 1 once 1 re-entered 1 daily 1 life. 1 \u201cOh, 1 what 1 a 1 funny 1 thing! 1 Some 1 one 1 said 1 just 1 the 1 same 1 to 1 mother, 1 and 1 she 1 said 1 she 1 trusted 1 I 1 should 1 never 1 live 1 a 1 duet.\u201d 1 \u201cDoesn\u2019t 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 like 1 music?\u201d 1 \u201cShe 1 doesn\u2019t 1 mind 1 it. 1 But 1 she 1 doesn\u2019t 1 like 1 one 1 to 1 get 1 excited 1 over 1 anything; 1 she 1 thinks 1 I 1 am 1 silly 1 about 1 it. 1 She 1 thinks--I 1 can\u2019t 1 make 1 out. 1 Once, 1 you 1 know, 1 I 1 said 1 that 1 I 1 liked 1 my 1 own 1 playing 1 better 1 than 1 any 1 one\u2019s. 1 She 1 has 1 never 1 got 1 over 1 it. 1 Of 1 course, 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 mean 1 that 1 I 1 played 1 well; 1 I 1 only 1 meant--\u201d 1 \u201cOf 1 course,\u201d 1 said 1 he, 1 wondering 1 why 1 she 1 bothered 1 to 1 explain. 1 \u201cMusic--\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 as 1 if 1 attempting 1 some 1 generality. 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 complete 1 it, 1 and 1 looked 1 out 1 absently 1 upon 1 Italy 1 in 1 the 1 wet. 1 The 1 whole 1 life 1 of 1 the 1 South 1 was 1 disorganized, 1 and 1 the 1 most 1 graceful 1 nation 1 in 1 Europe 1 had 1 turned 1 into 1 formless 1 lumps 1 of 1 clothes. 1 The 1 street 1 and 1 the 1 river 1 were 1 dirty 1 yellow, 1 the 1 bridge 1 was 1 dirty 1 grey, 1 and 1 the 1 hills 1 were 1 dirty 1 purple. 1 Somewhere 1 in 1 their 1 folds 1 were 1 concealed 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 and 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 had 1 chosen 1 this 1 afternoon 1 to 1 visit 1 the 1 Torre 1 del 1 Gallo. 1 \u201cWhat 1 about 1 music?\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cPoor 1 Charlotte 1 will 1 be 1 sopped,\u201d 1 was 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 reply. 1 The 1 expedition 1 was 1 typical 1 of 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 who 1 would 1 return 1 cold, 1 tired, 1 hungry, 1 and 1 angelic, 1 with 1 a 1 ruined 1 skirt, 1 a 1 pulpy 1 Baedeker, 1 and 1 a 1 tickling 1 cough 1 in 1 her 1 throat. 1 On 1 another 1 day, 1 when 1 the 1 whole 1 world 1 was 1 singing 1 and 1 the 1 air 1 ran 1 into 1 the 1 mouth, 1 like 1 wine, 1 she 1 would 1 refuse 1 to 1 stir 1 from 1 the 1 drawing-room, 1 saying 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 an 1 old 1 thing, 1 and 1 no 1 fit 1 companion 1 for 1 a 1 hearty 1 girl. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Lavish 1 has 1 led 1 your 1 cousin 1 astray. 1 She 1 hopes 1 to 1 find 1 the 1 true 1 Italy 1 in 1 the 1 wet 1 I 1 believe.\u201d 1 \u201cMiss 1 Lavish 1 is 1 so 1 original,\u201d 1 murmured 1 Lucy. 1 This 1 was 1 a 1 stock 1 remark, 1 the 1 supreme 1 achievement 1 of 1 the 1 Pension 1 Bertolini 1 in 1 the 1 way 1 of 1 definition. 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 was 1 so 1 original. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 had 1 his 1 doubts, 1 but 1 they 1 would 1 have 1 been 1 put 1 down 1 to 1 clerical 1 narrowness. 1 For 1 that, 1 and 1 for 1 other 1 reasons, 1 he 1 held 1 his 1 peace. 1 \u201cIs 1 it 1 true,\u201d 1 continued 1 Lucy 1 in 1 awe-struck 1 tone, 1 \u201cthat 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 is 1 writing 1 a 1 book?\u201d 1 \u201cThey 1 do 1 say 1 so.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 is 1 it 1 about?\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 will 1 be 1 a 1 novel,\u201d 1 replied 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 \u201cdealing 1 with 1 modern 1 Italy. 1 Let 1 me 1 refer 1 you 1 for 1 an 1 account 1 to 1 Miss 1 Catharine 1 Alan, 1 who 1 uses 1 words 1 herself 1 more 1 admirably 1 than 1 any 1 one 1 I 1 know.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 wish 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 would 1 tell 1 me 1 herself. 1 We 1 started 1 such 1 friends. 1 But 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 think 1 she 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 run 1 away 1 with 1 Baedeker 1 that 1 morning 1 in 1 Santa 1 Croce. 1 Charlotte 1 was 1 most 1 annoyed 1 at 1 finding 1 me 1 practically 1 alone, 1 and 1 so 1 I 1 couldn\u2019t 1 help 1 being 1 a 1 little 1 annoyed 1 with 1 Miss 1 Lavish.\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 two 1 ladies, 1 at 1 all 1 events, 1 have 1 made 1 it 1 up.\u201d 1 He 1 was 1 interested 1 in 1 the 1 sudden 1 friendship 1 between 1 women 1 so 1 apparently 1 dissimilar 1 as 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 and 1 Miss 1 Lavish. 1 They 1 were 1 always 1 in 1 each 1 other\u2019s 1 company, 1 with 1 Lucy 1 a 1 slighted 1 third. 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 he 1 believed 1 he 1 understood, 1 but 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 might 1 reveal 1 unknown 1 depths 1 of 1 strangeness, 1 though 1 not 1 perhaps, 1 of 1 meaning. 1 Was 1 Italy 1 deflecting 1 her 1 from 1 the 1 path 1 of 1 prim 1 chaperon, 1 which 1 he 1 had 1 assigned 1 to 1 her 1 at 1 Tunbridge 1 Wells? 1 All 1 his 1 life 1 he 1 had 1 loved 1 to 1 study 1 maiden 1 ladies; 1 they 1 were 1 his 1 specialty, 1 and 1 his 1 profession 1 had 1 provided 1 him 1 with 1 ample 1 opportunities 1 for 1 the 1 work. 1 Girls 1 like 1 Lucy 1 were 1 charming 1 to 1 look 1 at, 1 but 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was, 1 from 1 rather 1 profound 1 reasons, 1 somewhat 1 chilly 1 in 1 his 1 attitude 1 towards 1 the 1 other 1 sex, 1 and 1 preferred 1 to 1 be 1 interested 1 rather 1 than 1 enthralled. 1 Lucy, 1 for 1 the 1 third 1 time, 1 said 1 that 1 poor 1 Charlotte 1 would 1 be 1 sopped. 1 The 1 Arno 1 was 1 rising 1 in 1 flood, 1 washing 1 away 1 the 1 traces 1 of 1 the 1 little 1 carts 1 upon 1 the 1 foreshore. 1 But 1 in 1 the 1 south-west 1 there 1 had 1 appeared 1 a 1 dull 1 haze 1 of 1 yellow, 1 which 1 might 1 mean 1 better 1 weather 1 if 1 it 1 did 1 not 1 mean 1 worse. 1 She 1 opened 1 the 1 window 1 to 1 inspect, 1 and 1 a 1 cold 1 blast 1 entered 1 the 1 room, 1 drawing 1 a 1 plaintive 1 cry 1 from 1 Miss 1 Catharine 1 Alan, 1 who 1 entered 1 at 1 the 1 same 1 moment 1 by 1 the 1 door. 1 \u201cOh, 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cYou?\u201d 1 Freddy 1 nodded. 1 \u201cWhat 1 do 1 you 1 mean?\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 asked 1 me 1 for 1 my 1 permission 1 also.\u201d 1 She 1 exclaimed: 1 \u201cHow 1 very 1 odd 1 of 1 him!\u201d 1 \u201cWhy 1 so?\u201d 1 asked 1 the 1 son 1 and 1 heir. 1 \u201cWhy 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 my 1 permission 1 be 1 asked?\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 do 1 you 1 know 1 about 1 Lucy 1 or 1 girls 1 or 1 anything? 1 What 1 ever 1 did 1 you 1 say?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 said 1 to 1 Cecil, 1 \u2018Take 1 her 1 or 1 leave 1 her; 1 it\u2019s 1 no 1 business 1 of 1 mine!\u2019\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 a 1 helpful 1 answer!\u201d 1 But 1 her 1 own 1 answer, 1 though 1 more 1 normal 1 in 1 its 1 wording, 1 had 1 been 1 to 1 the 1 same 1 effect. 1 \u201cThe 1 bother 1 is 1 this,\u201d 1 began 1 Freddy. 1 Then 1 he 1 took 1 up 1 his 1 work 1 again, 1 too 1 shy 1 to 1 say 1 what 1 the 1 bother 1 was. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 went 1 back 1 to 1 the 1 window. 1 \u201cFreddy, 1 you 1 must 1 come. 1 There 1 they 1 still 1 are!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 you 1 ought 1 to 1 go 1 peeping 1 like 1 that.\u201d 1 \u201cPeeping 1 like 1 that! 1 Can\u2019t 1 I 1 look 1 out 1 of 1 my 1 own 1 window?\u201d 1 But 1 she 1 returned 1 to 1 the 1 writing-table, 1 observing, 1 as 1 she 1 passed 1 her 1 son, 1 \u201cStill 1 page 1 322?\u201d 1 Freddy 1 snorted, 1 and 1 turned 1 over 1 two 1 leaves. 1 For 1 a 1 brief 1 space 1 they 1 were 1 silent. 1 Close 1 by, 1 beyond 1 the 1 curtains, 1 the 1 gentle 1 murmur 1 of 1 a 1 long 1 conversation 1 had 1 never 1 ceased. 1 \u201cThe 1 bother 1 is 1 this: 1 I 1 have 1 put 1 my 1 foot 1 in 1 it 1 with 1 Cecil 1 most 1 awfully.\u201d 1 He 1 gave 1 a 1 nervous 1 gulp. 1 \u201cNot 1 content 1 with 1 \u2018permission\u2019, 1 which 1 I 1 did 1 give--that 1 is 1 to 1 say, 1 I 1 said, 1 \u2018I 1 don\u2019t 1 mind\u2019--well, 1 not 1 content 1 with 1 that, 1 he 1 wanted 1 to 1 know 1 whether 1 I 1 wasn\u2019t 1 off 1 my 1 head 1 with 1 joy. 1 He 1 practically 1 put 1 it 1 like 1 this: 1 Wasn\u2019t 1 it 1 a 1 splendid 1 thing 1 for 1 Lucy 1 and 1 for 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 generally 1 if 1 he 1 married 1 her? 1 And 1 he 1 would 1 have 1 an 1 answer--he 1 said 1 it 1 would 1 strengthen 1 his 1 hand.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 hope 1 you 1 gave 1 a 1 careful 1 answer, 1 dear.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 answered 1 \u2018No\u2019\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 boy, 1 grinding 1 his 1 teeth. 1 \u201cThere! 1 Fly 1 into 1 a 1 stew! 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 help 1 it--had 1 to 1 say 1 it. 1 I 1 had 1 to 1 say 1 no. 1 He 1 ought 1 never 1 to 1 have 1 asked 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cRidiculous 1 child!\u201d 1 cried 1 his 1 mother. 1 \u201cYou 1 think 1 you\u2019re 1 so 1 holy 1 and 1 truthful, 1 but 1 really 1 it\u2019s 1 only 1 abominable 1 conceit. 1 Do 1 you 1 suppose 1 that 1 a 1 man 1 like 1 Cecil 1 would 1 take 1 the 1 slightest 1 notice 1 of 1 anything 1 you 1 say? 1 I 1 hope 1 he 1 boxed 1 your 1 ears. 1 How 1 dare 1 you 1 say 1 no?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 do 1 keep 1 quiet, 1 mother! 1 I 1 had 1 to 1 say 1 no 1 when 1 I 1 couldn\u2019t 1 say 1 yes. 1 I 1 tried 1 to 1 laugh 1 as 1 if 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 mean 1 what 1 I 1 said, 1 and, 1 as 1 Cecil 1 laughed 1 too, 1 and 1 went 1 away, 1 it 1 may 1 be 1 all 1 right. 1 But 1 I 1 feel 1 my 1 foot\u2019s 1 in 1 it. 1 Oh, 1 do 1 keep 1 quiet, 1 though, 1 and 1 let 1 a 1 man 1 do 1 some 1 work.\u201d 1 \u201cNo,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 with 1 the 1 air 1 of 1 one 1 who 1 has 1 considered 1 the 1 subject, 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 not 1 keep 1 quiet. 1 You 1 know 1 all 1 that 1 has 1 passed 1 between 1 them 1 in 1 Rome; 1 you 1 know 1 why 1 he 1 is 1 down 1 here, 1 and 1 yet 1 you 1 deliberately 1 insult 1 him, 1 and 1 try 1 to 1 turn 1 him 1 out 1 of 1 my 1 house.\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 a 1 bit!\u201d 1 he 1 pleaded. 1 \u201cI 1 only 1 let 1 out 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 like 1 him. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 hate 1 him, 1 but 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 like 1 him. 1 What 1 I 1 mind 1 is 1 that 1 he\u2019ll 1 tell 1 Lucy.\u201d 1 He 1 glanced 1 at 1 the 1 curtains 1 dismally. 1 \u201cWell, 1 I 1 like 1 him,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch. 1 \u201cI 1 know 1 his 1 mother; 1 he\u2019s 1 good, 1 he\u2019s 1 clever, 1 he\u2019s 1 rich, 1 he\u2019s 1 well 1 connected--Oh, 1 you 1 needn\u2019t 1 kick 1 the 1 piano! 1 He\u2019s 1 well 1 connected--I\u2019ll 1 say 1 it 1 again 1 if 1 you 1 like: 1 he\u2019s 1 well 1 connected.\u201d 1 She 1 paused, 1 as 1 if 1 rehearsing 1 her 1 eulogy, 1 but 1 her 1 face 1 remained 1 dissatisfied. 1 She 1 added: 1 \u201cAnd 1 he 1 has 1 beautiful 1 manners.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 liked 1 him 1 till 1 just 1 now. 1 I 1 suppose 1 it\u2019s 1 having 1 him 1 spoiling 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 first 1 week 1 at 1 home; 1 and 1 it\u2019s 1 also 1 something 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 said, 1 not 1 knowing.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe?\u201d 1 said 1 his 1 mother, 1 trying 1 to 1 conceal 1 her 1 interest. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 how 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 comes 1 in.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 know 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 funny 1 way, 1 when 1 you 1 never 1 quite 1 know 1 what 1 he 1 means. 1 He 1 said: 1 \u2018Mr. 1 Vyse 1 is 1 an 1 ideal 1 bachelor.\u2019 1 I 1 was 1 very 1 cute, 1 I 1 asked 1 him 1 what 1 he 1 meant. 1 He 1 said 1 \u2018Oh, 1 he\u2019s 1 like 1 me--better 1 detached.\u2019 1 I 1 couldn\u2019t 1 make 1 him 1 say 1 any 1 more, 1 but 1 it 1 set 1 me 1 thinking. 1 Since 1 Cecil 1 has 1 come 1 after 1 Lucy 1 he 1 hasn\u2019t 1 been 1 so 1 pleasant, 1 at 1 least--I 1 can\u2019t 1 explain.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 never 1 can, 1 dear. 1 But 1 I 1 can. 1 You 1 are 1 jealous 1 of 1 Cecil 1 because 1 he 1 may 1 stop 1 Lucy 1 knitting 1 you 1 silk 1 ties.\u201d 1 The 1 explanation 1 seemed 1 plausible, 1 and 1 Freddy 1 tried 1 to 1 accept 1 it. 1 But 1 at 1 the 1 back 1 of 1 his 1 brain 1 there 1 lurked 1 a 1 dim 1 mistrust. 1 Cecil 1 praised 1 one 1 too 1 much 1 for 1 being 1 athletic. 1 Was 1 that 1 it? 1 Cecil 1 made 1 one 1 talk 1 in 1 one\u2019s 1 own 1 way. 1 This 1 tired 1 one. 1 Was 1 that 1 it? 1 And 1 Cecil 1 was 1 the 1 kind 1 of 1 fellow 1 who 1 would 1 never 1 wear 1 another 1 fellow\u2019s 1 cap. 1 Unaware 1 of 1 his 1 own 1 profundity, 1 Freddy 1 checked 1 himself. 1 He 1 must 1 be 1 jealous, 1 or 1 he 1 would 1 not 1 dislike 1 a 1 man 1 for 1 such 1 foolish 1 reasons. 1 \u201cWill 1 this 1 do?\u201d 1 called 1 his 1 mother. 1 \u201c\u2018Dear 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse,--Cecil 1 has 1 just 1 asked 1 my 1 permission 1 about 1 it, 1 and 1 I 1 should 1 be 1 delighted 1 if 1 Lucy 1 wishes 1 it.\u2019 1 Then 1 I 1 put 1 in 1 at 1 the 1 top, 1 \u2018and 1 I 1 have 1 told 1 Lucy 1 so.\u2019 1 I 1 must 1 write 1 the 1 letter 1 out 1 again--\u2018and 1 I 1 have 1 told 1 Lucy 1 so. 1 But 1 Lucy 1 seems 1 very 1 uncertain, 1 and 1 in 1 these 1 days 1 young 1 people 1 must 1 decide 1 for 1 themselves.\u2019 1 I 1 said 1 that 1 because 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 want 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 to 1 think 1 us 1 old-fashioned. 1 She 1 goes 1 in 1 for 1 lectures 1 and 1 improving 1 her 1 mind, 1 and 1 all 1 the 1 time 1 a 1 thick 1 layer 1 of 1 flue 1 under 1 the 1 beds, 1 and 1 the 1 maid\u2019s 1 dirty 1 thumb-marks 1 where 1 you 1 turn 1 on 1 the 1 electric 1 light. 1 She 1 keeps 1 that 1 flat 1 abominably--\u201d 1 \u201cSuppose 1 Lucy 1 marries 1 Cecil, 1 would 1 she 1 live 1 in 1 a 1 flat, 1 or 1 in 1 the 1 country?\u201d 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 interrupt 1 so 1 foolishly. 1 Where 1 was 1 I? 1 Oh 1 yes--\u2018Young 1 people 1 must 1 decide 1 for 1 themselves. 1 I 1 know 1 that 1 Lucy 1 likes 1 your 1 son, 1 because 1 she 1 tells 1 me 1 everything, 1 and 1 she 1 wrote 1 to 1 me 1 from 1 Rome 1 when 1 he 1 asked 1 her 1 first.\u2019 1 No, 1 I\u2019ll 1 cross 1 that 1 last 1 bit 1 out--it 1 looks 1 patronizing. 1 I\u2019ll 1 stop 1 at 1 \u2018because 1 she 1 tells 1 me 1 everything.\u2019 1 Or 1 shall 1 I 1 cross 1 that 1 out, 1 too?\u201d 1 \u201cCross 1 it 1 out, 1 too,\u201d 1 said 1 Freddy. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 left 1 it 1 in. 1 \u201cThen 1 the 1 whole 1 thing 1 runs: 1 \u2018Dear 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse.--Cecil 1 has 1 just 1 asked 1 my 1 permission 1 about 1 it, 1 and 1 I 1 should 1 be 1 delighted 1 if 1 Lucy 1 wishes 1 it, 1 and 1 I 1 have 1 told 1 Lucy 1 so. 1 But 1 Lucy 1 seems 1 very 1 uncertain, 1 and 1 in 1 these 1 days 1 young 1 people 1 must 1 decide 1 for 1 themselves. 1 I 1 know 1 that 1 Lucy 1 likes 1 your 1 son, 1 because 1 she 1 tells 1 me 1 everything. 1 But 1 I 1 do 1 not 1 know--\u2019\u201d 1 \u201cLook 1 out!\u201d 1 cried 1 Freddy. 1 The 1 curtains 1 parted. 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 first 1 movement 1 was 1 one 1 of 1 irritation. 1 He 1 couldn\u2019t 1 bear 1 the 1 Honeychurch 1 habit 1 of 1 sitting 1 in 1 the 1 dark 1 to 1 save 1 the 1 furniture. 1 Instinctively 1 he 1 give 1 the 1 curtains 1 a 1 twitch, 1 and 1 sent 1 them 1 swinging 1 down 1 their 1 poles. 1 Light 1 entered. 1 There 1 was 1 revealed 1 a 1 terrace, 1 such 1 as 1 is 1 owned 1 by 1 many 1 villas 1 with 1 trees 1 each 1 side 1 of 1 it, 1 and 1 on 1 it 1 a 1 little 1 rustic 1 seat, 1 and 1 two 1 flower-beds. 1 But 1 it 1 was 1 transfigured 1 by 1 the 1 view 1 beyond, 1 for 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 was 1 built 1 on 1 the 1 range 1 that 1 overlooks 1 the 1 Sussex 1 Weald. 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 was 1 in 1 the 1 little 1 seat, 1 seemed 1 on 1 the 1 edge 1 of 1 a 1 green 1 magic 1 carpet 1 which 1 hovered 1 in 1 the 1 air 1 above 1 the 1 tremulous 1 world. 1 Cecil 1 entered. 1 Appearing 1 thus 1 late 1 in 1 the 1 story, 1 Cecil 1 must 1 be 1 at 1 once 1 described. 1 He 1 was 1 medieval. 1 Like 1 a 1 Gothic 1 statue. 1 Tall 1 and 1 refined, 1 with 1 shoulders 1 that 1 seemed 1 braced 1 square 1 by 1 an 1 effort 1 of 1 the 1 will, 1 and 1 a 1 head 1 that 1 was 1 tilted 1 a 1 little 1 higher 1 than 1 the 1 usual 1 level 1 of 1 vision, 1 he 1 resembled 1 those 1 fastidious 1 saints 1 who 1 guard 1 the 1 portals 1 of 1 a 1 French 1 cathedral. 1 Well 1 educated, 1 well 1 endowed, 1 and 1 not 1 deficient 1 physically, 1 he 1 remained 1 in 1 the 1 grip 1 of 1 a 1 certain 1 devil 1 whom 1 the 1 modern 1 world 1 knows 1 as 1 self-consciousness, 1 and 1 whom 1 the 1 medieval, 1 with 1 dimmer 1 vision, 1 worshipped 1 as 1 asceticism. 1 A 1 Gothic 1 statue 1 implies 1 celibacy, 1 just 1 as 1 a 1 Greek 1 statue 1 implies 1 fruition, 1 and 1 perhaps 1 this 1 was 1 what 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 meant. 1 And 1 Freddy, 1 who 1 ignored 1 history 1 and 1 art, 1 perhaps 1 meant 1 the 1 same 1 when 1 he 1 failed 1 to 1 imagine 1 Cecil 1 wearing 1 another 1 fellow\u2019s 1 cap. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 left 1 her 1 letter 1 on 1 the 1 writing 1 table 1 and 1 moved 1 towards 1 her 1 young 1 acquaintance. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Cecil!\u201d 1 she 1 exclaimed--\u201coh, 1 Cecil, 1 do 1 tell 1 me!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 promessi 1 sposi,\u201d 1 said 1 he. 1 They 1 stared 1 at 1 him 1 anxiously. 1 \u201cShe 1 has 1 accepted 1 me,\u201d 1 he 1 said, 1 and 1 the 1 sound 1 of 1 the 1 thing 1 in 1 English 1 made 1 him 1 flush 1 and 1 smile 1 with 1 pleasure, 1 and 1 look 1 more 1 human. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 so 1 glad,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 while 1 Freddy 1 proffered 1 a 1 hand 1 that 1 was 1 yellow 1 with 1 chemicals. 1 They 1 wished 1 that 1 they 1 also 1 knew 1 Italian, 1 for 1 our 1 phrases 1 of 1 approval 1 and 1 of 1 amazement 1 are 1 so 1 connected 1 with 1 little 1 occasions 1 that 1 we 1 fear 1 to 1 use 1 them 1 on 1 great 1 ones. 1 We 1 are 1 obliged 1 to 1 become 1 vaguely 1 poetic, 1 or 1 to 1 take 1 refuge 1 in 1 Scriptural 1 reminiscences. 1 \u201cWelcome 1 as 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 family!\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 waving 1 her 1 hand 1 at 1 the 1 furniture. 1 \u201cThis 1 is 1 indeed 1 a 1 joyous 1 day! 1 I 1 feel 1 sure 1 that 1 you 1 will 1 make 1 our 1 dear 1 Lucy 1 happy.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 hope 1 so,\u201d 1 replied 1 the 1 young 1 man, 1 shifting 1 his 1 eyes 1 to 1 the 1 ceiling. 1 \u201cWe 1 mothers--\u201d 1 simpered 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 and 1 then 1 realized 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 affected, 1 sentimental, 1 bombastic--all 1 the 1 things 1 she 1 hated 1 most. 1 Why 1 could 1 she 1 not 1 be 1 Freddy, 1 who 1 stood 1 stiff 1 in 1 the 1 middle 1 of 1 the 1 room; 1 looking 1 very 1 cross 1 and 1 almost 1 handsome? 1 \u201cI 1 say, 1 Lucy!\u201d 1 called 1 Cecil, 1 for 1 conversation 1 seemed 1 to 1 flag. 1 Lucy 1 rose 1 from 1 the 1 seat. 1 She 1 moved 1 across 1 the 1 lawn 1 and 1 smiled 1 in 1 at 1 them, 1 just 1 as 1 if 1 she 1 was 1 going 1 to 1 ask 1 them 1 to 1 play 1 tennis. 1 Then 1 she 1 saw 1 her 1 brother\u2019s 1 face. 1 Her 1 lips 1 parted, 1 and 1 she 1 took 1 him 1 in 1 her 1 arms. 1 He 1 said, 1 \u201cSteady 1 on!\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 a 1 kiss 1 for 1 me?\u201d 1 asked 1 her 1 mother. 1 Lucy 1 kissed 1 her 1 also. 1 \u201cWould 1 you 1 take 1 them 1 into 1 the 1 garden 1 and 1 tell 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 all 1 about 1 it?\u201d 1 Cecil 1 suggested. 1 \u201cAnd 1 I\u2019d 1 stop 1 here 1 and 1 tell 1 my 1 mother.\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 go 1 with 1 Lucy?\u201d 1 said 1 Freddy, 1 as 1 if 1 taking 1 orders. 1 \u201cYes, 1 you 1 go 1 with 1 Lucy.\u201d 1 They 1 passed 1 into 1 the 1 sunlight. 1 Cecil 1 watched 1 them 1 cross 1 the 1 terrace, 1 and 1 descend 1 out 1 of 1 sight 1 by 1 the 1 steps. 1 They 1 would 1 descend--he 1 knew 1 their 1 ways--past 1 the 1 shrubbery, 1 and 1 past 1 the 1 tennis-lawn 1 and 1 the 1 dahlia-bed, 1 until 1 they 1 reached 1 the 1 kitchen 1 garden, 1 and 1 there, 1 in 1 the 1 presence 1 of 1 the 1 potatoes 1 and 1 the 1 peas, 1 the 1 great 1 event 1 would 1 be 1 discussed. 1 Smiling 1 indulgently, 1 he 1 lit 1 a 1 cigarette, 1 and 1 rehearsed 1 the 1 events 1 that 1 had 1 led 1 to 1 such 1 a 1 happy 1 conclusion. 1 He 1 had 1 known 1 Lucy 1 for 1 several 1 years, 1 but 1 only 1 as 1 a 1 commonplace 1 girl 1 who 1 happened 1 to 1 be 1 musical. 1 He 1 could 1 still 1 remember 1 his 1 depression 1 that 1 afternoon 1 at 1 Rome, 1 when 1 she 1 and 1 her 1 terrible 1 cousin 1 fell 1 on 1 him 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 blue, 1 and 1 demanded 1 to 1 be 1 taken 1 to 1 St. 1 Peter\u2019s. 1 That 1 day 1 books 1 that 1 surrounded 1 him 1 another, 1 so 1 mild 1 to 1 the 1 rough 1 paths 1 that 1 he 1 had 1 traversed, 1 that 1 the 1 true 1 chivalry--not 1 the 1 worn-out 1 chivalry 1 of 1 sex, 1 but 1 the 1 true 1 chivalry 1 that 1 all 1 the 1 young 1 may 1 show 1 to 1 all 1 the 1 old--awoke 1 in 1 her, 1 and, 1 at 1 whatever 1 risk, 1 she 1 told 1 him 1 that 1 Cecil 1 was 1 not 1 her 1 companion 1 to 1 Greece. 1 And 1 she 1 spoke 1 so 1 seriously 1 that 1 the 1 risk 1 became 1 a 1 certainty, 1 and 1 he, 1 lifting 1 his 1 eyes, 1 said: 1 \u201cYou 1 are 1 leaving 1 him? 1 You 1 are 1 leaving 1 the 1 man 1 you 1 love?\u201d 1 \u201cI--I 1 had 1 to.\u201d 1 \u201cWhy, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 why?\u201d 1 Terror 1 came 1 over 1 her, 1 and 1 she 1 lied 1 again. 1 She 1 made 1 the 1 long, 1 convincing 1 speech 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 made 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 and 1 intended 1 to 1 make 1 to 1 the 1 world 1 when 1 she 1 announced 1 that 1 her 1 engagement 1 was 1 no 1 more. 1 He 1 heard 1 her 1 in 1 silence, 1 and 1 then 1 said: 1 \u201cMy 1 dear, 1 I 1 am 1 worried 1 about 1 you. 1 It 1 seems 1 to 1 me\u201d--dreamily; 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 alarmed--\u201cthat 1 you 1 are 1 in 1 a 1 muddle.\u201d 1 She 1 shook 1 her 1 head. 1 \u201cTake 1 an 1 old 1 man\u2019s 1 word; 1 there\u2019s 1 nothing 1 worse 1 than 1 a 1 muddle 1 in 1 all 1 the 1 world. 1 It 1 is 1 easy 1 to 1 face 1 Death 1 and 1 Fate, 1 and 1 the 1 things 1 that 1 sound 1 so 1 dreadful. 1 It 1 is 1 on 1 my 1 muddles 1 that 1 I 1 look 1 back 1 with 1 horror--on 1 the 1 things 1 that 1 I 1 might 1 have 1 avoided. 1 We 1 can 1 help 1 one 1 another 1 but 1 little. 1 I 1 used 1 to 1 think 1 I 1 could 1 teach 1 young 1 people 1 the 1 whole 1 of 1 life, 1 but 1 I 1 know 1 better 1 now, 1 and 1 all 1 my 1 teaching 1 of 1 George 1 has 1 come 1 down 1 to 1 this: 1 beware 1 of 1 muddle. 1 Do 1 you 1 remember 1 in 1 that 1 church, 1 when 1 you 1 pretended 1 to 1 be 1 annoyed 1 with 1 me 1 and 1 weren\u2019t? 1 Do 1 you 1 remember 1 before, 1 when 1 you 1 refused 1 the 1 room 1 with 1 the 1 view? 1 Those 1 were 1 muddles--little, 1 but 1 ominous--and 1 I 1 am 1 fearing 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 in 1 one 1 now.\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 silent. 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 trust 1 me, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch. 1 Though 1 life 1 is 1 very 1 glorious, 1 it 1 is 1 difficult.\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 still 1 silent. 1 \u201c\u2018Life\u2019 1 wrote 1 a 1 friend 1 of 1 mine, 1 \u2018is 1 a 1 public 1 performance 1 on 1 the 1 violin, 1 in 1 which 1 you 1 must 1 learn 1 the 1 instrument 1 as 1 you 1 go 1 along.\u2019 1 I 1 think 1 he 1 puts 1 it 1 well. 1 Man 1 has 1 to 1 pick 1 up 1 the 1 use 1 of 1 his 1 functions 1 as 1 he 1 goes 1 along--especially 1 the 1 function 1 of 1 Love.\u201d 1 Then 1 he 1 burst 1 out 1 excitedly; 1 \u201cThat\u2019s 1 it; 1 that\u2019s 1 what 1 I 1 mean. 1 You 1 love 1 George!\u201d 1 And 1 after 1 his 1 long 1 preamble, 1 the 1 three 1 words 1 burst 1 against 1 Lucy 1 like 1 waves 1 from 1 the 1 open 1 sea. 1 \u201cBut 1 you 1 do,\u201d 1 he 1 went 1 on, 1 not 1 waiting 1 for 1 contradiction. 1 \u201cYou 1 love 1 the 1 boy 1 body 1 and 1 soul, 1 plainly, 1 directly, 1 as 1 he 1 loves 1 you, 1 and 1 no 1 other 1 word 1 expresses 1 it. 1 You 1 won\u2019t 1 marry 1 the 1 other 1 man 1 for 1 his 1 sake.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 dare 1 you!\u201d 1 gasped 1 Lucy, 1 with 1 the 1 roaring 1 of 1 waters 1 in 1 her 1 ears. 1 \u201cOh, 1 how 1 like 1 a 1 man!--I 1 mean, 1 to 1 suppose 1 that 1 a 1 woman 1 is 1 always 1 thinking 1 about 1 a 1 man.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 you 1 are.\u201d 1 She 1 summoned 1 physical 1 disgust. 1 \u201cYou\u2019re 1 shocked, 1 but 1 I 1 mean 1 to 1 shock 1 you. 1 It\u2019s 1 the 1 only 1 hope 1 at 1 times. 1 I 1 can 1 reach 1 you 1 no 1 other 1 way. 1 You 1 must 1 marry, 1 or 1 your 1 life 1 will 1 be 1 wasted. 1 You 1 have 1 gone 1 too 1 far 1 to 1 retreat. 1 I 1 have 1 no 1 time 1 for 1 the 1 tenderness, 1 and 1 the 1 comradeship, 1 and 1 the 1 poetry, 1 and 1 the 1 things 1 that 1 really 1 matter, 1 and 1 for 1 which 1 you 1 marry. 1 I 1 know 1 that, 1 with 1 George, 1 you 1 will 1 find 1 them, 1 and 1 that 1 you 1 love 1 him. 1 Then 1 be 1 his 1 wife. 1 He 1 is 1 already 1 part 1 of 1 you. 1 Though 1 you 1 fly 1 to 1 Greece, 1 and 1 never 1 see 1 him 1 again, 1 or 1 forget 1 his 1 very 1 name, 1 George 1 will 1 work 1 in 1 your 1 thoughts 1 till 1 you 1 die. 1 It 1 isn\u2019t 1 possible 1 to 1 love 1 and 1 to 1 part. 1 You 1 will 1 wish 1 that 1 it 1 was. 1 You 1 can 1 transmute 1 love, 1 ignore 1 it, 1 muddle 1 it, 1 but 1 you 1 can 1 never 1 pull 1 it 1 out 1 of 1 you. 1 I 1 know 1 by 1 experience 1 that 1 the 1 poets 1 are 1 right: 1 love 1 is 1 eternal.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 began 1 to 1 cry 1 with 1 anger, 1 and 1 though 1 her 1 anger 1 passed 1 away 1 soon, 1 her 1 tears 1 remained. 1 \u201cI 1 only 1 wish 1 poets 1 would 1 say 1 this, 1 too: 1 love 1 is 1 of 1 the 1 body; 1 not 1 the 1 body, 1 but 1 of 1 the 1 body. 1 Ah! 1 the 1 misery 1 that 1 would 1 be 1 saved 1 if 1 we 1 confessed 1 that! 1 Ah! 1 for 1 a 1 little 1 directness 1 to 1 liberate 1 the 1 soul! 1 Your 1 soul, 1 dear 1 Lucy! 1 I 1 hate 1 the 1 word 1 now, 1 because 1 of 1 all 1 the 1 cant 1 with 1 which 1 superstition 1 has 1 wrapped 1 it 1 round. 1 But 1 we 1 have 1 souls. 1 I 1 cannot 1 say 1 how 1 they 1 came 1 nor 1 whither 1 they 1 go, 1 but 1 we 1 have 1 them, 1 and 1 I 1 see 1 you 1 ruining 1 yours. 1 I 1 cannot 1 bear 1 it. 1 It 1 is 1 again 1 the 1 darkness 1 creeping 1 in; 1 it 1 is 1 hell.\u201d 1 Then 1 he 1 checked 1 himself. 1 \u201cWhat 1 nonsense 1 I 1 have 1 talked--how 1 abstract 1 and 1 remote! 1 And 1 I 1 have 1 made 1 you 1 cry! 1 Dear 1 girl, 1 forgive 1 my 1 prosiness; 1 marry 1 my 1 boy. 1 When 1 I 1 think 1 what 1 life 1 is, 1 and 1 how 1 seldom 1 love 1 is 1 answered 1 by 1 love--Marry 1 him; 1 it 1 is 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 moments 1 for 1 which 1 the 1 world 1 was 1 made.\u201d 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 understand 1 him; 1 the 1 words 1 were 1 indeed 1 remote. 1 Yet 1 as 1 he 1 spoke 1 the 1 darkness 1 was 1 withdrawn, 1 veil 1 after 1 veil, 1 and 1 she 1 saw 1 to 1 the 1 bottom 1 of 1 her 1 soul. 1 \u201cThen, 1 Lucy--\u201d 1 \u201cYou\u2019ve 1 frightened 1 me,\u201d 1 she 1 moaned. 1 \u201cCecil--Mr. 1 Beebe--the 1 ticket\u2019s 1 bought--everything.\u201d 1 She 1 fell 1 sobbing 1 into 1 the 1 chair. 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 caught 1 in 1 the 1 tangle. 1 I 1 must 1 suffer 1 and 1 grow 1 old 1 away 1 from 1 him. 1 I 1 cannot 1 break 1 the 1 whole 1 of 1 life 1 for 1 his 1 sake. 1 They 1 trusted 1 me.\u201d 1 A 1 carriage 1 drew 1 up 1 at 1 the 1 front-door. 1 \u201cGive 1 George 1 my 1 love--once 1 only. 1 Tell 1 him 1 \u2018muddle.\u2019\u201d 1 Then 1 she 1 arranged 1 her 1 veil, 1 while 1 the 1 tears 1 poured 1 over 1 her 1 cheeks 1 inside. 1 \u201cLucy--\u201d 1 \u201cNo--they 1 are 1 in 1 the 1 hall--oh, 1 please 1 not, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson--they 1 trust 1 me--\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 why 1 should 1 they, 1 when 1 you 1 have 1 deceived 1 them?\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 opened 1 the 1 door, 1 saying: 1 \u201cHere\u2019s 1 my 1 mother.\u201d 1 \u201cYou\u2019re 1 not 1 worthy 1 of 1 their 1 trust.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat\u2019s 1 that?\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 sharply. 1 \u201cI 1 was 1 saying, 1 why 1 should 1 you 1 trust 1 her 1 when 1 she 1 deceived 1 you?\u201d 1 \u201cOne 1 minute, 1 mother.\u201d 1 He 1 came 1 in 1 and 1 shut 1 the 1 door. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 follow 1 you, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson. 1 To 1 whom 1 do 1 you 1 refer? 1 Trust 1 whom?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 mean 1 she 1 has 1 pretended 1 to 1 you 1 that 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 love 1 George. 1 They 1 have 1 loved 1 one 1 another 1 all 1 along.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 looked 1 at 1 the 1 sobbing 1 girl. 1 He 1 was 1 very 1 quiet, 1 and 1 his 1 white 1 face, 1 with 1 its 1 ruddy 1 whiskers, 1 seemed 1 suddenly 1 inhuman. 1 A 1 long 1 black 1 column, 1 he 1 stood 1 and 1 awaited 1 her 1 reply. 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 never 1 marry 1 him,\u201d 1 quavered 1 Lucy. 1 A 1 look 1 of 1 contempt 1 came 1 over 1 him, 1 and 1 he 1 said, 1 \u201cWhy 1 not?\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe--I 1 have 1 misled 1 you--I 1 have 1 misled 1 myself--\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 rubbish, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch!\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 not 1 rubbish!\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 old 1 man 1 hotly. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 the 1 part 1 of 1 people 1 that 1 you 1 don\u2019t 1 understand.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 laid 1 his 1 hand 1 on 1 the 1 old 1 man\u2019s 1 shoulder 1 pleasantly. 1 \u201cLucy! 1 Lucy!\u201d 1 called 1 voices 1 from 1 the 1 carriage. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe, 1 could 1 you 1 help 1 me?\u201d 1 He 1 looked 1 amazed 1 at 1 the 1 request, 1 and 1 said 1 in 1 a 1 low, 1 stern 1 voice: 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 more 1 grieved 1 than 1 I 1 can 1 possibly 1 express. 1 It 1 is 1 lamentable, 1 lamentable--incredible.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat\u2019s 1 wrong 1 with 1 the 1 boy?\u201d 1 fired 1 up 1 the 1 other 1 again. 1 \u201cNothing, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 except 1 that 1 he 1 no 1 longer 1 interests 1 me. 1 Marry 1 George, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch. 1 He 1 will 1 do 1 admirably.\u201d 1 He 1 walked 1 out 1 and 1 left 1 them. 1 They 1 heard 1 him 1 guiding 1 his 1 mother 1 up-stairs. 1 \u201cLucy!\u201d 1 the 1 voices 1 called. 1 She 1 turned 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 in 1 despair. 1 But 1 his 1 face 1 revived 1 her. 1 It 1 was 1 the 1 face 1 of 1 a 1 saint 1 who 1 understood. 1 \u201cNow 1 it 1 is 1 all 1 dark. 1 Now 1 Beauty 1 and 1 Passion 1 seem 1 never 1 to 1 have 1 existed. 1 I 1 know. 1 But 1 remember 1 the 1 mountains 1 over 1 Florence 1 and 1 the 1 view. 1 Ah, 1 dear, 1 if 1 I 1 were 1 George, 1 and 1 gave 1 you 1 one 1 kiss, 1 it 1 would 1 make 1 you 1 brave. 1 You 1 have 1 to 1 go 1 cold 1 into 1 a 1 battle 1 that 1 needs 1 warmth, 1 out 1 into 1 the 1 muddle 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 made 1 yourself; 1 and 1 your 1 mother 1 and 1 all 1 your 1 friends 1 will 1 despise 1 you, 1 oh, 1 my 1 darling, 1 and 1 rightly, 1 if 1 it 1 is 1 ever 1 right 1 to 1 despise. 1 George 1 still 1 dark, 1 all 1 the 1 tussle 1 and 1 the 1 misery 1 without 1 a 1 word 1 from 1 him. 1 Am 1 I 1 justified?\u201d 1 Into 1 his 1 own 1 eyes 1 tears 1 came. 1 \u201cYes, 1 for 1 we 1 fight 1 for 1 more 1 than 1 Love 1 or 1 Pleasure; 1 there 1 is 1 Truth. 1 Truth 1 counts, 1 Truth 1 does 1 count.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 kiss 1 me,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 girl. 1 \u201cYou 1 kiss 1 me. 1 I 1 will 1 try.\u201d 1 He 1 gave 1 her 1 a 1 sense 1 of 1 deities 1 reconciled, 1 a 1 feeling 1 that, 1 in 1 gaining 1 the 1 man 1 she 1 loved, 1 she 1 would 1 gain 1 something 1 for 1 the 1 whole 1 world. 1 Throughout 1 the 1 squalor 1 of 1 her 1 homeward 1 drive--she 1 spoke 1 at 1 once--his 1 salutation 1 remained. 1 He 1 had 1 robbed 1 the 1 body 1 of 1 its 1 taint, 1 the 1 world\u2019s 1 taunts 1 of 1 their 1 sting; 1 he 1 had 1 shown 1 her 1 the 1 holiness 1 of 1 direct 1 desire. 1 She 1 \u201cnever 1 exactly 1 understood,\u201d 1 she 1 would 1 say 1 in 1 after 1 years, 1 \u201chow 1 he 1 managed 1 to 1 strengthen 1 her. 1 It 1 was 1 as 1 if 1 he 1 had 1 made 1 her 1 see 1 the 1 whole 1 of 1 everything 1 at 1 once.\u201d 1 Chapter 1 XX: 1 The 1 End 1 of 1 the 1 Middle 1 Ages 1 The 1 Miss 1 Alans 1 did 1 go 1 to 1 Greece, 1 but 1 they 1 went 1 by 1 themselves. 1 They 1 alone 1 of 1 this 1 little 1 company 1 will 1 double 1 Malea 1 and 1 plough 1 the 1 waters 1 of 1 the 1 Saronic 1 gulf. 1 They 1 alone 1 will 1 visit 1 Athens 1 and 1 Delphi, 1 and 1 either 1 shrine 1 of 1 intellectual 1 song--that 1 upon 1 the 1 Acropolis, 1 encircled 1 by 1 blue 1 seas; 1 that 1 under 1 Parnassus, 1 where 1 the 1 eagles 1 build 1 and 1 the 1 bronze 1 charioteer 1 drives 1 undismayed 1 towards 1 infinity. 1 Trembling, 1 anxious, 1 cumbered 1 with 1 much 1 digestive 1 bread, 1 they 1 did 1 proceed 1 to 1 Constantinople, 1 they 1 did 1 go 1 round 1 the 1 world. 1 The 1 rest 1 of 1 us 1 must 1 be 1 contented 1 with 1 a 1 fair, 1 but 1 a 1 less 1 arduous, 1 goal. 1 Italiam 1 petimus: 1 we 1 return 1 to 1 the 1 Pension 1 Bertolini. 1 George 1 said 1 it 1 was 1 his 1 old 1 room. 1 \u201cNo, 1 it 1 isn\u2019t,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy; 1 \u201cbecause 1 it 1 is 1 the 1 room 1 I 1 had, 1 and 1 I 1 had 1 your 1 father\u2019s 1 room. 1 I 1 forget 1 why; 1 Charlotte 1 made 1 me, 1 for 1 some 1 reason.\u201d 1 He 1 knelt 1 on 1 the 1 tiled 1 floor, 1 and 1 laid 1 his 1 face 1 in 1 her 1 lap. 1 \u201cGeorge, 1 you 1 baby, 1 get 1 up.\u201d 1 \u201cWhy 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 I 1 be 1 a 1 baby?\u201d 1 murmured 1 George. 1 Unable 1 to 1 answer 1 this 1 question, 1 she 1 put 1 down 1 his 1 sock, 1 which 1 she 1 was 1 trying 1 to 1 mend, 1 and 1 gazed 1 out 1 through 1 the 1 window. 1 It 1 was 1 evening 1 and 1 again 1 the 1 spring. 1 \u201cOh, 1 bother 1 Charlotte,\u201d 1 she 1 said 1 thoughtfully. 1 \u201cWhat 1 can 1 such 1 people 1 be 1 made 1 of?\u201d 1 \u201cSame 1 stuff 1 as 1 parsons 1 are 1 made 1 of.\u201d 1 \u201cNonsense!\u201d 1 \u201cQuite 1 right. 1 It 1 is 1 nonsense.\u201d 1 \u201cNow 1 you 1 get 1 up 1 off 1 the 1 cold 1 floor, 1 or 1 you\u2019ll 1 be 1 starting 1 rheumatism 1 next, 1 and 1 you 1 stop 1 laughing 1 and 1 being 1 so 1 silly.\u201d 1 \u201cWhy 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 I 1 laugh?\u201d 1 he 1 asked, 1 pinning 1 her 1 with 1 his 1 elbows, 1 and 1 advancing 1 his 1 face 1 to 1 hers. 1 \u201cWhat\u2019s 1 there 1 to 1 cry 1 at? 1 Kiss 1 me 1 here.\u201d 1 He 1 indicated 1 the 1 spot 1 where 1 a 1 kiss 1 would 1 be 1 welcome. 1 He 1 was 1 a 1 boy 1 after 1 all. 1 When 1 it 1 came 1 to 1 the 1 point, 1 it 1 was

strangely 1 that 1 he 1 should 1 be 1 sometimes 1 wrong. 1 \u201cAny 1 letters?\u201d 1 he 1 asked. 1 \u201cJust 1 a 1 line 1 from 1 Freddy.\u201d 1 \u201cNow 1 kiss 1 me 1 here; 1 then 1 here.\u201d

woman--Mr. 1 Eager! 1 Why, 1 how 1 nice! 1 What 1 a 1 pleasant 1 surprise!\u201d 1 \u201cAh, 1 not 1 for 1 me,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 chaplain 1 blandly, 1 \u201cfor 1 I 1 have 1 been 1 watching 1 you 1 and 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 for 1 quite 1 a 1 little 1 time.\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 were 1 chatting 1 to 1 Miss 1 Lavish.\u201d 1 His 1 brow 1 contracted. 1 \u201cSo 1 I 1 saw. 1 Were 1 you 1 indeed? 1 Andate 1 via! 1 sono 1 occupato!\u201d 1 The 1 last 1 remark 1 was 1 made 1 to 1 a 1 vender 1 of 1 panoramic 1 photographs 1 who 1 was 1 approaching 1 with 1 a 1 courteous 1 smile. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 about 1 to 1 venture 1 a 1 suggestion. 1 Would 1 you 1 and 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 be 1 disposed 1 to 1 join 1 me 1 in 1 a 1 drive 1 some 1 day 1 this 1 week--a 1 drive 1 in 1 the 1 hills? 1 We 1 might 1 go 1 up 1 by 1 Fiesole 1 and 1 back 1 by 1 Settignano. 1 There 1 is 1 a 1 point 1 on 1 that 1 road 1 where 1 we 1 could 1 get 1 down 1 and 1 have 1 an 1 hour\u2019s 1 ramble 1 on 1 the 1 hillside. 1 The 1 view 1 thence 1 of 1 Florence 1 is 1 most 1 beautiful--far 1 better 1 than 1 the 1 hackneyed 1 view 1 of 1 Fiesole. 1 It 1 is 1 the 1 view 1 that 1 Alessio 1 Baldovinetti 1 is 1 fond 1 of 1 introducing 1 into 1 his 1 pictures. 1 That 1 man 1 had 1 a 1 decided 1 feeling 1 for 1 landscape. 1 Decidedly. 1 But 1 who 1 looks 1 at 1 it 1 to-day? 1 Ah, 1 the 1 world 1 is 1 too 1 much 1 for 1 us.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 not 1 heard 1 of 1 Alessio 1 Baldovinetti, 1 but 1 she 1 knew 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 was 1 no 1 commonplace 1 chaplain. 1 He 1 was 1 a 1 member 1 of 1 the 1 residential 1 colony 1 who 1 had 1 made 1 Florence 1 their 1 home. 1 He 1 knew 1 the 1 people 1 who 1 never 1 walked 1 about 1 with 1 Baedekers, 1 who 1 had 1 learnt 1 to 1 take 1 a 1 siesta 1 after 1 lunch, 1 who 1 took 1 drives 1 the 1 pension 1 tourists 1 had 1 never 1 heard 1 of, 1 and 1 saw 1 by 1 private 1 influence 1 galleries 1 which 1 were 1 closed 1 to 1 them. 1 Living 1 in 1 delicate 1 seclusion, 1 some 1 in 1 furnished 1 flats, 1 others 1 in 1 Renaissance 1 villas 1 on 1 Fiesole\u2019s 1 slope, 1 they 1 read, 1 wrote, 1 studied, 1 and 1 exchanged 1 ideas, 1 thus 1 attaining 1 to 1 that 1 intimate 1 knowledge, 1 or 1 rather 1 perception, 1 of 1 Florence 1 which 1 is 1 denied 1 to 1 all 1 who 1 carry 1 in 1 their 1 pockets 1 the 1 coupons 1 of 1 Cook. 1 Therefore 1 an 1 invitation 1 from 1 the 1 chaplain 1 was 1 something 1 to 1 be 1 proud 1 of. 1 Between 1 the 1 two 1 sections 1 of 1 his 1 flock 1 he 1 was 1 often 1 the 1 only 1 link, 1 and 1 it 1 was 1 his 1 avowed 1 custom 1 to 1 select 1 those 1 of 1 his 1 migratory 1 sheep 1 who 1 seemed 1 worthy, 1 and 1 give 1 them 1 a 1 few 1 hours 1 in 1 the 1 pastures 1 of 1 the 1 permanent. 1 Tea 1 at 1 a 1 Renaissance 1 villa? 1 Nothing 1 had 1 been 1 said 1 about 1 it 1 yet. 1 But 1 if 1 it 1 did 1 come 1 to 1 that--how 1 Lucy 1 would 1 enjoy 1 it! 1 A 1 few 1 days 1 ago 1 and 1 Lucy 1 would 1 have 1 felt 1 the 1 same. 1 But 1 the 1 joys 1 of 1 life 1 were 1 grouping 1 themselves 1 anew. 1 A 1 drive 1 in 1 the 1 hills 1 with 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 and 1 Miss 1 Bartlett--even 1 if 1 culminating 1 in 1 a 1 residential 1 tea-party--was 1 no 1 longer 1 the 1 greatest 1 of 1 them. 1 She 1 echoed 1 the 1 raptures 1 of 1 Charlotte 1 somewhat 1 faintly. 1 Only 1 when 1 she 1 heard 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 also 1 coming 1 did 1 her 1 thanks 1 become 1 more 1 sincere. 1 \u201cSo 1 we 1 shall 1 be 1 a 1 partie 1 carree,\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 chaplain. 1 \u201cIn 1 these 1 days 1 of 1 toil 1 and 1 tumult 1 one 1 has 1 great 1 needs 1 of 1 the 1 country 1 and 1 its 1 message 1 of 1 purity. 1 Andate 1 via! 1 andate 1 presto, 1 presto! 1 Ah, 1 the 1 town! 1 Beautiful 1 as 1 it 1 is, 1 it 1 is 1 the 1 town.\u201d 1 They 1 assented. 1 \u201cThis 1 very 1 square--so 1 I 1 am 1 told--witnessed 1 yesterday 1 the 1 most 1 sordid 1 of 1 tragedies. 1 To 1 one 1 who 1 loves 1 the 1 Florence 1 of 1 Dante 1 and 1 Savonarola 1 there 1 is 1 something 1 portentous 1 in 1 such 1 desecration--portentous 1 and 1 humiliating.\u201d 1 \u201cHumiliating 1 indeed,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch 1 happened 1 to 1 be 1 passing 1 through 1 as 1 it 1 happened. 1 She 1 can 1 hardly 1 bear 1 to 1 speak 1 of 1 it.\u201d 1 She 1 glanced 1 at 1 Lucy 1 proudly. 1 \u201cAnd 1 how 1 came 1 we 1 to 1 have 1 you 1 here?\u201d 1 asked 1 the 1 chaplain 1 paternally. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 recent 1 liberalism 1 oozed 1 away 1 at 1 the 1 question. 1 \u201cDo 1 not 1 blame 1 her, 1 please, 1 Mr. 1 Eager. 1 The 1 fault 1 is 1 mine: 1 I 1 left 1 her 1 unchaperoned.\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 you 1 were 1 here 1 alone, 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch?\u201d 1 His 1 voice 1 suggested 1 sympathetic 1 reproof 1 but 1 at 1 the 1 same 1 time 1 indicated 1 that 1 a 1 few 1 harrowing 1 details 1 would 1 not 1 be 1 unacceptable. 1 His 1 dark, 1 handsome 1 face 1 drooped 1 mournfully 1 towards 1 her 1 to 1 catch 1 her 1 reply. 1 \u201cPractically.\u201d 1 \u201cOne 1 of 1 our 1 pension 1 acquaintances 1 kindly 1 brought 1 her 1 home,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 adroitly 1 concealing 1 the 1 sex 1 of 1 the 1 preserver. 1 \u201cFor 1 her 1 also 1 it 1 must 1 have 1 been 1 a 1 terrible 1 experience. 1 I 1 trust 1 that 1 neither 1 of 1 you 1 was 1 at 1 all--that 1 it 1 was 1 not 1 in 1 your 1 immediate 1 proximity?\u201d 1 Of 1 the 1 many 1 things 1 Lucy 1 was 1 noticing 1 to-day, 1 not 1 the 1 least 1 remarkable 1 was 1 this: 1 the 1 ghoulish 1 fashion 1 in 1 which 1 respectable 1 people 1 will 1 nibble 1 after 1 blood. 1 George 1 Emerson 1 had 1 kept 1 the 1 subject 1 strangely 1 pure. 1 \u201cHe 1 died 1 by 1 the 1 fountain, 1 I 1 believe,\u201d 1 was 1 her 1 reply. 1 \u201cAnd 1 you 1 and 1 your 1 friend--\u201d 1 \u201cWere 1 over 1 at 1 the 1 Loggia.\u201d 1 \u201cThat 1 must 1 have 1 saved 1 you 1 much. 1 You 1 have 1 not, 1 of 1 course, 1 seen 1 the 1 disgraceful 1 illustrations 1 which 1 the 1 gutter 1 Press--This 1 man 1 is 1 a 1 public 1 nuisance; 1 he 1 knows 1 that 1 I 1 am 1 a 1 resident 1 perfectly 1 well, 1 and 1 yet 1 he 1 goes 1 on 1 worrying 1 me 1 to 1 buy 1 his 1 vulgar 1 views.\u201d 1 Surely 1 the 1 vendor 1 of 1 photographs 1 was 1 in 1 league 1 with 1 Lucy--in 1 the 1 eternal 1 league 1 of 1 Italy 1 with 1 youth. 1 He 1 had 1 suddenly 1 extended 1 his 1 book 1 before 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 binding 1 their 1 hands 1 together 1 by 1 a 1 long 1 glossy 1 ribbon 1 of 1 churches, 1 pictures, 1 and 1 views. 1 \u201cThis 1 is 1 too 1 much!\u201d 1 cried 1 the 1 chaplain, 1 striking 1 petulantly 1 at 1 one 1 of 1 Fra 1 Angelico\u2019s 1 angels. 1 She 1 tore. 1 A 1 shrill 1 cry 1 rose 1 from 1 the 1 vendor. 1 The 1 book 1 it 1 seemed, 1 was 1 more 1 valuable 1 than 1 one 1 would 1 have 1 supposed. 1 \u201cWillingly 1 would 1 I 1 purchase--\u201d 1 began 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cIgnore 1 him,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 sharply, 1 and 1 they 1 all 1 walked 1 rapidly 1 away 1 from 1 the 1 square. 1 But 1 an 1 Italian 1 can 1 never 1 be 1 ignored, 1 least 1 of 1 all 1 when 1 he 1 has 1 a 1 grievance. 1 His 1 mysterious 1 persecution 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 became 1 relentless; 1 the 1 air 1 rang 1 with 1 his 1 threats 1 and 1 lamentations. 1 He 1 appealed 1 to 1 Lucy; 1 would 1 not 1 she 1 intercede? 1 He 1 was 1 poor--he 1 sheltered 1 a 1 family--the 1 tax 1 on 1 bread. 1 He 1 waited, 1 he 1 gibbered, 1 he 1 was 1 recompensed, 1 he 1 was 1 dissatisfied, 1 he 1 did 1 not 1 leave 1 them 1 until 1 he 1 had 1 swept 1 their 1 minds 1 clean 1 of 1 all 1 thoughts 1 whether 1 pleasant 1 or 1 unpleasant. 1 Shopping 1 was 1 the 1 topic 1 that 1 now 1 ensued. 1 Under 1 the 1 chaplain\u2019s 1 guidance 1 they 1 selected 1 many 1 hideous 1 presents 1 and 1 mementoes--florid 1 little 1 picture-frames 1 that 1 seemed 1 fashioned 1 in 1 gilded 1 pastry; 1 other 1 little 1 frames, 1 more 1 severe, 1 that 1 stood 1 on 1 little 1 easels, 1 and 1 were 1 carven 1 out 1 of 1 oak; 1 a 1 blotting 1 book 1 of 1 vellum; 1 a 1 Dante 1 of 1 the 1 same 1 material; 1 cheap 1 mosaic 1 brooches, 1 which 1 the 1 maids, 1 next 1 Christmas, 1 would 1 never 1 tell 1 from 1 real; 1 pins, 1 pots, 1 heraldic 1 saucers, 1 brown 1 art-photographs; 1 Eros 1 and 1 Psyche 1 in 1 alabaster; 1 St. 1 Peter 1 to 1 match--all 1 of 1 which 1 would 1 have 1 cost 1 less 1 in 1 London. 1 This 1 successful 1 morning 1 left 1 no 1 pleasant 1 impressions 1 on 1 Lucy. 1 She 1 had 1 been 1 a 1 little 1 frightened, 1 both 1 by 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 and 1 by 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 she 1 knew 1 not 1 why. 1 And 1 as 1 they 1 frightened 1 her, 1 she 1 had, 1 strangely 1 enough, 1 ceased 1 to 1 respect 1 them. 1 She 1 doubted 1 that 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 was 1 a 1 great 1 artist. 1 She 1 doubted 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 was 1 as 1 full 1 of 1 spirituality 1 and 1 culture 1 as 1 she 1 had 1 been 1 led 1 to 1 suppose. 1 They 1 were 1 tried 1 by 1 some 1 new 1 test, 1 and 1 they 1 were 1 found 1 wanting. 1 As 1 for 1 Charlotte--as 1 for 1 Charlotte 1 she 1 was 1 exactly 1 the 1 same. 1 It 1 might 1 be 1 possible 1 to 1 be 1 nice 1 to 1 her; 1 it 1 was 1 impossible 1 to 1 love 1 her. 1 \u201cThe 1 son 1 of 1 a 1 labourer; 1 I 1 happen 1 to 1 know 1 it 1 for 1 a 1 fact. 1 A 1 mechanic 1 of 1 some 1 sort 1 himself 1 when 1 he 1 was 1 young; 1 then 1 he 1 took 1 to 1 writing 1 for 1 the 1 Socialistic 1 Press. 1 I 1 came 1 across 1 him 1 at 1 Brixton.\u201d 1 They 1 were 1 talking 1 about 1 the 1 Emersons. 1 \u201cHow 1 wonderfully 1 people 1 rise 1 in 1 these 1 days!\u201d 1 sighed 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 fingering 1 a 1 model 1 of 1 the 1 leaning 1 Tower 1 of 1 Pisa. 1 \u201cGenerally,\u201d 1 replied 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 \u201cone 1 has 1 only 1 sympathy 1 for 1 their 1 success. 1 The 1 desire 1 for 1 education 1 and 1 for 1 social 1 advance--in 1 these 1 things 1 there 1 is 1 something 1 not 1 wholly 1 vile. 1 There 1 are 1 some 1 working 1 men 1 whom 1 one 1 would 1 be 1 very 1 willing 1 to 1 see 1 out 1 here 1 in 1 Florence--little 1 as 1 they 1 would 1 make 1 of 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cIs 1 he 1 a 1 journalist 1 now?\u201d 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 asked. 1 \u201cHe 1 is 1 not; 1 he 1 made 1 an 1 advantageous 1 marriage.\u201d 1 He 1 uttered 1 this 1 remark 1 with 1 a 1 voice 1 full 1 of 1 meaning, 1 and 1 ended 1 with 1 a 1 sigh. 1 \u201cOh, 1 so 1 he 1 has 1 a 1 wife.\u201d 1 \u201cDead, 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 dead. 1 I 1 wonder--yes 1 I 1 wonder 1 how 1 he 1 has 1 the 1 effrontery 1 to 1 look 1 me 1 in 1 the 1 face, 1 to 1 dare 1 to 1 claim 1 acquaintance 1 with 1 me. 1 He 1 was 1 in 1 my 1 London 1 parish 1 long 1 ago. 1 The 1 other 1 day 1 in 1 Santa 1 Croce, 1 when 1 he 1 was 1 with 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 I 1 snubbed 1 him. 1 Let 1 him 1 beware 1 that 1 he 1 does 1 not 1 get 1 more 1 than 1 a 1 snub.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat?\u201d 1 cried 1 Lucy, 1 flushing. 1 \u201cExposure!\u201d 1 hissed 1 Mr. 1 Eager. 1 He 1 tried 1 to 1 change 1 the 1 subject; 1 but 1 in 1 scoring 1 a 1 dramatic 1 point 1 he 1 had 1 interested 1 his 1 audience 1 more 1 than 1 he 1 had 1 intended. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 was 1 full 1 of 1 very 1 natural 1 curiosity. 1 Lucy, 1 though 1 she 1 wished 1 never 1 to 1 see 1 the 1 Emersons 1 again, 1 was 1 not 1 disposed 1 to 1 condemn 1 them 1 on 1 a 1 single 1 word. 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 mean,\u201d 1 she 1 asked, 1 \u201cthat 1 he 1 is 1 an 1 irreligious 1 man? 1 We 1 know 1 that 1 already.\u201d 1 \u201cLucy, 1 dear--\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 gently 1 reproving 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s 1 penetration. 1 \u201cI 1 should 1 be 1 astonished 1 if 1 you 1 knew 1 all. 1 The 1 boy--an 1 innocent 1 child 1 at 1 the 1 time--I 1 will 1 exclude. 1 God 1 knows 1 what 1 his 1 education 1 and 1 his 1 inherited 1 qualities 1 may 1 have 1 made 1 him.\u201d 1 \u201cPerhaps,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 \u201cit 1 is 1 something 1 that 1 we 1 had 1 better 1 not 1 hear.\u201d 1 \u201cTo 1 speak 1 plainly,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 \u201cit 1 is. 1 I 1 will 1 say 1 no 1 more.\u201d 1 For 1 the 1 first 1 time 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 rebellious 1 thoughts 1 swept 1 out 1 in 1 words--for 1 the 1 first 1 time 1 in 1 her 1 life. 1 \u201cYou 1 have 1 said 1 very 1 little.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 was 1 my 1 intention 1 to 1 say 1 very 1 little,\u201d 1 was 1 his 1 frigid 1 reply. 1 He 1 gazed 1 indignantly 1 at 1 the 1 girl, 1 who 1 met 1 him 1 with 1 equal 1 indignation. 1 She 1 turned 1 towards 1 him 1 from 1 the 1 shop 1 counter; 1 her 1 breast 1 heaved 1 quickly. 1 He 1 observed 1 her 1 brow, 1 and 1 the 1 sudden 1 strength 1 of 1 her 1 lips. 1 It 1 was 1 intolerable 1 that 1 she 1 should 1 disbelieve 1 him. 1 \u201cMurder, 1 if 1 you 1 want 1 to 1 know,\u201d 1 he 1 cried 1 angrily. 1 \u201cThat 1 man 1 murdered 1 his 1 wife!\u201d 1 \u201cHow?\u201d 1 she 1 retorted. 1 \u201cTo 1 all 1 intents 1 and 1 purposes 1 he 1 murdered 1 her. 1 That 1 day 1 in 1 Santa 1 Croce--did 1 they 1 say 1 anything 1 against 1 me?\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 a 1 word, 1 Mr. 1 Eager--not 1 a 1 single 1 word.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 I 1 thought 1 they 1 had 1 been 1 libelling 1 me 1 to 1 you. 1 But 1 I 1 suppose 1 it 1 is 1 only 1 their 1 personal 1 charms 1 that 1 makes 1 you 1 defend 1 them.\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 not 1 defending 1 them,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 losing 1 her 1 courage, 1 and 1 relapsing 1 into 1 the 1 old 1 chaotic 1 methods. 1 \u201cThey\u2019re 1 nothing 1 to 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 could 1 you 1 think 1 she 1 was 1 defending 1 them?\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 much 1 discomfited 1 by 1 the 1 unpleasant 1 scene. 1 The 1 shopman 1 was 1 possibly 1 listening. 1 \u201cShe 1 will 1 find 1 it 1 difficult. 1 eye 1 wavered 1 when 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 exclaimed: 1 \u201cBeware! 1 They 1 are 1 certain 1 to 1 have 1 canaries. 1 Sir 1 Harry, 1 beware 1 of 1 canaries: 1 they 1 spit 1 the 1 seed 1 out 1 through 1 the 1 bars 1 of 1 the 1 cages 1 and 1 then 1 the 1 mice 1 come. 1 Beware 1 of 1 women 1 altogether. 1 Only 1 let 1 to 1 a 1 man.\u201d 1 \u201cReally--\u201d 1 he 1 murmured 1 gallantly, 1 though 1 he 1 saw 1 the 1 wisdom 1 of 1 her 1 remark. 1 \u201cMen 1 don\u2019t 1 gossip 1 over 1 tea-cups. 1 If 1 they 1 get 1 drunk, 1 there\u2019s 1 an 1 end 1 of 1 them--they 1 lie 1 down 1 comfortably 1 and 1 sleep 1 it 1 off. 1 If 1 they\u2019re 1 vulgar, 1 they 1 somehow 1 keep 1 it 1 to 1 themselves. 1 It 1 doesn\u2019t 1 spread 1 so. 1 Give 1 me 1 a 1 man--of 1 course, 1 provided 1 he\u2019s 1 clean.\u201d 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 blushed. 1 Neither 1 he 1 nor 1 Cecil 1 enjoyed 1 these 1 open 1 compliments 1 to 1 their 1 sex. 1 Even 1 the 1 exclusion 1 of 1 the 1 dirty 1 did 1 not 1 leave 1 them 1 much 1 distinction. 1 He 1 suggested 1 that 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 if 1 she 1 had 1 time, 1 should 1 descend 1 from 1 the 1 carriage 1 and 1 inspect 1 \u201cCissie\u201d 1 for 1 herself. 1 She 1 was 1 delighted. 1 Nature 1 had 1 intended 1 her 1 to 1 be 1 poor 1 and 1 to 1 live 1 in 1 such 1 a 1 house. 1 Domestic 1 arrangements 1 always 1 attracted 1 her, 1 especially 1 when 1 they 1 were 1 on 1 a 1 small 1 scale. 1 Cecil 1 pulled 1 Lucy 1 back 1 as 1 she 1 followed 1 her 1 mother. 1 \u201cMrs. 1 Honeychurch,\u201d 1 he 1 said, 1 \u201cwhat 1 if 1 we 1 two 1 walk 1 home 1 and 1 leave 1 you?\u201d 1 \u201cCertainly!\u201d 1 was 1 her 1 cordial 1 reply. 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 likewise 1 seemed 1 almost 1 too 1 glad 1 to 1 get 1 rid 1 of 1 them. 1 He 1 beamed 1 at 1 them 1 knowingly, 1 said, 1 \u201cAha! 1 young 1 people, 1 young 1 people!\u201d 1 and 1 then 1 hastened 1 to 1 unlock 1 the 1 house. 1 \u201cHopeless 1 vulgarian!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Cecil, 1 almost 1 before 1 they 1 were 1 out 1 of 1 earshot. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Cecil!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 help 1 it. 1 It 1 would 1 be 1 wrong 1 not 1 to 1 loathe 1 that 1 man.\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 isn\u2019t 1 clever, 1 but 1 really 1 he 1 is 1 nice.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 Lucy, 1 he 1 stands 1 for 1 all 1 that 1 is 1 bad 1 in 1 country 1 life. 1 In 1 London 1 he 1 would 1 keep 1 his 1 place. 1 He 1 would 1 belong 1 to 1 a 1 brainless 1 club, 1 and 1 his 1 wife 1 would 1 give 1 brainless 1 dinner 1 parties. 1 But 1 down 1 here 1 he 1 acts 1 the 1 little 1 god 1 with 1 his 1 gentility, 1 and 1 his 1 patronage, 1 and 1 his 1 sham 1 aesthetics, 1 and 1 everyone--even 1 your 1 mother--is 1 taken 1 in.\u201d 1 \u201cAll 1 that 1 you 1 say 1 is 1 quite 1 true,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 though 1 she 1 felt 1 discouraged. 1 \u201cI 1 wonder 1 whether--whether 1 it 1 matters 1 so 1 very 1 much.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 matters 1 supremely. 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 is 1 the 1 essence 1 of 1 that 1 garden-party. 1 Oh, 1 goodness, 1 how 1 cross 1 I 1 feel! 1 How 1 I 1 do 1 hope 1 he\u2019ll 1 get 1 some 1 vulgar 1 tenant 1 in 1 that 1 villa--some 1 woman 1 so 1 really 1 vulgar 1 that 1 he\u2019ll 1 notice 1 it. 1 GENTLEFOLKS! 1 Ugh! 1 with 1 his 1 bald 1 head 1 and 1 retreating 1 chin! 1 But 1 let\u2019s 1 forget 1 him.\u201d 1 This 1 Lucy 1 was 1 glad 1 enough 1 to 1 do. 1 If 1 Cecil 1 disliked 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway 1 and 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 what 1 guarantee 1 was 1 there 1 that 1 the 1 people 1 who 1 really 1 mattered 1 to 1 her 1 would 1 escape? 1 For 1 instance, 1 Freddy. 1 Freddy 1 was 1 neither 1 clever, 1 nor 1 subtle, 1 nor 1 beautiful, 1 and 1 what 1 prevented 1 Cecil 1 from 1 saying, 1 any 1 minute, 1 \u201cIt 1 would 1 be 1 wrong 1 not 1 to 1 loathe 1 Freddy\u201d? 1 And 1 what 1 would 1 she 1 reply? 1 Further 1 than 1 Freddy 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 go, 1 but 1 he 1 gave 1 her 1 anxiety 1 enough. 1 She 1 could 1 only 1 assure 1 herself 1 that 1 Cecil 1 had 1 known 1 Freddy 1 some 1 time, 1 and 1 that 1 they 1 had 1 always 1 got 1 on 1 pleasantly, 1 except, 1 perhaps, 1 during 1 the 1 last 1 few 1 days, 1 which 1 was 1 an 1 accident, 1 perhaps. 1 \u201cWhich 1 way 1 shall 1 we 1 go?\u201d 1 she 1 asked 1 him. 1 Nature--simplest 1 of 1 topics, 1 she 1 thought--was 1 around 1 them. 1 Summer 1 Street 1 lay 1 deep 1 in 1 the 1 woods, 1 and 1 she 1 had 1 stopped 1 where 1 a 1 footpath 1 diverged 1 from 1 the 1 highroad. 1 \u201cAre 1 there 1 two 1 ways?\u201d 1 \u201cPerhaps 1 the 1 road 1 is 1 more 1 sensible, 1 as 1 we\u2019re 1 got 1 up 1 smart.\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019d 1 rather 1 go 1 through 1 the 1 wood,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 With 1 that 1 subdued 1 irritation 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 noticed 1 in 1 him 1 all 1 the 1 afternoon. 1 \u201cWhy 1 is 1 it, 1 Lucy, 1 that 1 you 1 always 1 say 1 the 1 road? 1 Do 1 you 1 know 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 never 1 once 1 been 1 with 1 me 1 in 1 the 1 fields 1 or 1 the 1 wood 1 since 1 we 1 were 1 engaged?\u201d 1 \u201cHaven\u2019t 1 I? 1 The 1 wood, 1 then,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 startled 1 at 1 his 1 queerness, 1 but 1 pretty 1 sure 1 that 1 he 1 would 1 explain 1 later; 1 it 1 was 1 not 1 his 1 habit 1 to 1 leave 1 her 1 in 1 doubt 1 as 1 to 1 his 1 meaning. 1 She 1 led 1 the 1 way 1 into 1 the 1 whispering 1 pines, 1 and 1 sure 1 enough 1 he 1 did 1 explain 1 before 1 they 1 had 1 gone 1 a 1 dozen 1 yards. 1 \u201cI 1 had 1 got 1 an 1 idea--I 1 dare 1 say 1 wrongly--that 1 you 1 feel 1 more 1 at 1 home 1 with 1 me 1 in 1 a 1 room.\u201d 1 \u201cA 1 room?\u201d 1 she 1 echoed, 1 hopelessly 1 bewildered. 1 \u201cYes. 1 Or, 1 at 1 the 1 most, 1 in 1 a 1 garden, 1 or 1 on 1 a 1 road. 1 Never 1 in 1 the 1 real 1 country 1 like 1 this.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 Cecil, 1 whatever 1 do 1 you 1 mean? 1 I 1 have 1 never 1 felt 1 anything 1 of 1 the 1 sort. 1 You 1 talk 1 as 1 if 1 I 1 was 1 a 1 kind 1 of 1 poetess 1 sort 1 of 1 person.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 know 1 that 1 you 1 aren\u2019t. 1 I 1 connect 1 you 1 with 1 a 1 view--a 1 certain 1 type 1 of 1 view. 1 Why 1 shouldn\u2019t 1 you 1 connect 1 me 1 with 1 a 1 room?\u201d 1 She 1 reflected 1 a 1 moment, 1 and 1 then 1 said, 1 laughing: 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 know 1 that 1 you\u2019re 1 right? 1 I 1 do. 1 I 1 must 1 be 1 a 1 poetess 1 after 1 all. 1 When 1 I 1 think 1 of 1 you 1 it\u2019s 1 always 1 as 1 in 1 a 1 room. 1 How 1 funny!\u201d 1 To 1 her 1 surprise, 1 he 1 seemed 1 annoyed. 1 \u201cA 1 drawing-room, 1 pray? 1 With 1 no 1 view?\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 with 1 no 1 view, 1 I 1 fancy. 1 Why 1 not?\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019d 1 rather,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 reproachfully, 1 \u201cthat 1 you 1 connected 1 me 1 with 1 the 1 open 1 air.\u201d 1 She 1 said 1 again, 1 \u201cOh, 1 Cecil, 1 whatever 1 do 1 you 1 mean?\u201d 1 As 1 no 1 explanation 1 was 1 forthcoming, 1 she 1 shook 1 off 1 the 1 subject 1 as 1 too 1 difficult 1 for 1 a 1 girl, 1 and 1 led 1 him 1 further 1 into 1 the 1 wood, 1 pausing 1 every 1 now 1 and 1 then 1 at 1 some 1 particularly 1 beautiful 1 or 1 familiar 1 combination 1 of 1 the 1 trees. 1 She 1 had 1 known 1 the 1 wood 1 between 1 Summer 1 Street 1 and 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 ever 1 since 1 she 1 could 1 walk 1 alone; 1 she 1 had 1 played 1 at 1 losing 1 Freddy 1 in 1 it, 1 when 1 Freddy 1 was 1 a 1 purple-faced 1 baby; 1 and 1 though 1 she 1 had 1 been 1 to 1 Italy, 1 it 1 had 1 lost 1 none 1 of 1 its 1 charm. 1 Presently 1 they 1 came 1 to 1 a 1 little 1 clearing 1 among 1 the 1 pines--another 1 tiny 1 green 1 alp, 1 solitary 1 this 1 time, 1 and 1 holding 1 in 1 its 1 bosom 1 a 1 shallow 1 pool. 1 She 1 exclaimed, 1 \u201cThe 1 Sacred 1 Lake!\u201d 1 \u201cWhy 1 do 1 you 1 call 1 it 1 that?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 can\u2019t 1 remember 1 why. 1 I 1 suppose 1 it 1 comes 1 out 1 of 1 some 1 book. 1 It\u2019s 1 only 1 a 1 puddle 1 now, 1 but 1 you 1 see 1 that 1 stream 1 going 1 through 1 it? 1 Well, 1 a 1 good 1 deal 1 of 1 water 1 comes 1 down 1 after 1 heavy 1 rains, 1 and 1 can\u2019t 1 get 1 away 1 at 1 once, 1 and 1 the 1 pool 1 becomes 1 quite 1 large 1 and 1 beautiful. 1 Then 1 Freddy 1 used 1 to 1 bathe 1 there. 1 He 1 is 1 very 1 fond 1 of 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 you?\u201d 1 He 1 meant, 1 \u201cAre 1 you 1 fond 1 of 1 it?\u201d 1 But 1 she 1 answered 1 dreamily, 1 \u201cI 1 bathed 1 here, 1 too, 1 till 1 I 1 was 1 found 1 out. 1 Then 1 there 1 was 1 a 1 row.\u201d 1 At 1 another 1 time 1 he 1 might 1 have 1 been 1 shocked, 1 for 1 he 1 had 1 depths 1 of 1 prudishness 1 within 1 him. 1 But 1 now? 1 with 1 his 1 momentary 1 cult 1 of 1 the 1 fresh 1 air, 1 he 1 was 1 delighted 1 at 1 her 1 admirable 1 simplicity. 1 He 1 looked 1 at 1 her 1 as 1 she 1 stood 1 by 1 the 1 pool\u2019s 1 edge. 1 She 1 was 1 got 1 up 1 smart, 1 as 1 she 1 phrased 1 it, 1 and 1 she 1 reminded 1 him 1 of 1 some 1 brilliant 1 flower 1 that 1 has 1 no 1 leaves 1 of 1 its 1 own, 1 but 1 blooms 1 abruptly 1 out 1 of 1 a 1 world 1 of 1 green. 1 \u201cWho 1 found 1 you 1 out?\u201d 1 \u201cCharlotte,\u201d 1 she 1 murmured. 1 \u201cShe 1 was 1 stopping 1 with 1 us. 1 Charlotte--Charlotte.\u201d 1 \u201cPoor 1 girl!\u201d 1 She 1 smiled 1 gravely. 1 A 1 certain 1 scheme, 1 from 1 which 1 hitherto 1 he 1 had 1 shrunk, 1 now 1 appeared 1 practical. 1 \u201cLucy!\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 I 1 suppose 1 we 1 ought 1 to 1 be 1 going,\u201d 1 was 1 her 1 reply. 1 \u201cLucy, 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 ask 1 something 1 of 1 you 1 that 1 I 1 have 1 never 1 asked 1 before.\u201d 1 At 1 the 1 serious 1 note 1 in 1 his 1 voice 1 she 1 stepped 1 frankly 1 and 1 kindly 1 towards 1 him. 1 \u201cWhat, 1 Cecil?\u201d 1 \u201cHitherto 1 never--not 1 even 1 that 1 day 1 on 1 the 1 lawn 1 when 1 you 1 agreed 1 to 1 marry 1 me--\u201d 1 He 1 became 1 self-conscious 1 and 1 kept 1 glancing 1 round 1 to 1 see 1 if 1 they 1 were 1 observed. 1 His 1 courage 1 had 1 gone. 1 \u201cYes?\u201d 1 \u201cUp 1 to 1 now 1 I 1 have 1 never 1 kissed 1 you.\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 as 1 scarlet 1 as 1 if 1 he 1 had 1 put 1 the 1 thing 1 most 1 indelicately. 1 \u201cNo--more 1 you 1 have,\u201d 1 she 1 stammered. 1 \u201cThen 1 I 1 ask 1 you--may 1 I 1 now?\u201d 1 \u201cOf 1 course, 1 you 1 may, 1 Cecil. 1 You 1 might 1 before. 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 run 1 at 1 you, 1 you 1 know.\u201d 1 At 1 that 1 supreme 1 moment 1 he 1 was 1 conscious 1 of 1 nothing 1 but 1 absurdities. 1 Her 1 reply 1 was 1 inadequate. 1 She 1 gave 1 such 1 a 1 business-like 1 lift 1 to 1 her 1 veil. 1 As 1 he 1 approached 1 her 1 he 1 found 1 time 1 to 1 wish 1 that 1 he 1 could 1 recoil. 1 As 1 he 1 touched 1 her, 1 his 1 gold 1 pince-nez 1 became 1 dislodged 1 and 1 was 1 flattened 1 between 1 them. 1 Such 1 was 1 the 1 embrace. 1 He 1 considered, 1 with 1 truth, 1 that 1 it 1 had 1 been 1 a 1 failure. 1 Passion 1 should 1 believe 1 itself 1 irresistible. 1 It 1 should 1 forget 1 civility 1 and 1 consideration 1 and 1 all 1 the 1 other 1 curses 1 of 1 a 1 refined 1 nature. 1 Above 1 all, 1 it 1 should 1 never 1 ask 1 for 1 leave 1 where 1 there 1 is 1 a 1 right 1 of 1 way. 1 Why 1 could 1 he 1 not 1 do 1 as 1 any 1 labourer 1 or 1 navvy--nay, 1 as 1 any 1 young 1 man 1 behind 1 the 1 counter 1 would 1 have 1 done? 1 He 1 recast 1 the 1 scene. 1 Lucy 1 was 1 standing 1 flowerlike 1 by 1 the 1 water, 1 he 1 rushed 1 up 1 and 1 took 1 her 1 in 1 his 1 arms; 1 she 1 rebuked 1 him, 1 permitted 1 him 1 and 1 revered 1 him 1 ever 1 after 1 for 1 his 1 manliness. 1 For 1 he 1 believed 1 that 1 women 1 revere 1 men 1 for 1 their 1 manliness. 1 They 1 left 1 the 1 pool 1 in 1 silence, 1 after 1 this 1 one 1 salutation. 1 He 1 waited 1 for 1 her 1 to 1 make 1 some 1 remark 1 which 1 should 1 show 1 him 1 her 1 inmost 1 thoughts. 1 At 1 last 1 she 1 spoke, 1 and 1 with 1 fitting 1 gravity. 1 \u201cEmerson 1 was 1 the 1 name, 1 not 1 Harris.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 name?\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 old 1 man\u2019s.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 old 1 man?\u201d 1 \u201cThat 1 old 1 man 1 I 1 told 1 you 1 about. 1 The 1 one 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 was 1 so 1 unkind 1 to.\u201d 1 He 1 could 1 not 1 know 1 that 1 this 1 was 1 the 1 most 1 intimate 1 conversation 1 they 1 had 1 ever 1 had. 1 Chapter 1 X: 1 Cecil 1 as 1 a 1 Humourist 1 The 1 society 1 out 1 of 1 which 1 Cecil 1 proposed 1 to 1 rescue 1 Lucy 1 was 1 perhaps 1 no 1 very 1 splendid 1 affair, 1 yet 1 it 1 was 1 more 1 splendid 1 than 1 her 1 antecedents 1 entitled 1 her 1 to. 1 Her 1 father, 1 a 1 prosperous 1 local 1 solicitor, 1 had 1 built 1 Windy 1 Corner, 1 as 1 a 1 speculation 1 at 1 the 1 time 1 the 1 district 1 was 1 opening 1 up, 1 and, 1 falling 1 in 1 love 1 with 1 his 1 own 1 creation, 1 had 1 ended 1 by 1 living 1 there 1 himself. 1 Soon 1 after 1 his 1 marriage 1 the 1 social 1 atmosphere 1 began 1 to 1 alter. 1 Other 1 houses 1 were 1 built 1 on 1 the 1 brow 1 of 1 that 1 steep 1 southern 1 slope 1 and 1 others, 1 again, 1 among 1 the 1 pine-trees 1 behind, 1 and 1 northward 1 on 1 the 1 chalk 1 barrier 1 of 1 the 1 downs. 1 Most 1 of 1 these 1 houses 1 were 1 larger 1 than 1 Windy 1 Corner, 1 and 1 were 1 filled 1 by 1 people 1 who 1 came, 1 not 1 from 1 the 1 district, 1 but 1 from 1 London, 1 and 1 who 1 mistook 1 the 1 Honeychurches 1 for 1 the 1 remnants 1 of 1 an 1 indigenous 1 aristocracy. 1 He 1 was 1 inclined 1 to 1 be 1 frightened, 1 but 1 his 1 wife 1 accepted 1 the 1 situation 1 without 1 either 1 pride 1 or 1 humility. 1 \u201cI 1 cannot 1 think 1 what 1 people 1 are 1 doing,\u201d 1 she 1 would 1 say, 1 \u201cbut 1 it 1 is 1 extremely 1 fortunate 1 for 1 the 1 children.\u201d 1 She 1 called 1 everywhere; 1 her 1 calls 1 were 1 returned 1 with 1 enthusiasm, 1 and 1 by 1 the 1 time 1 people 1 found 1 out 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 not 1 exactly 1 of 1 their 1 milieu, 1 they 1 liked 1 her, 1 and 1 it 1 did 1 not 1 seem 1 to 1 matter. 1 When 1 Mr. 1 Honeychurch 1 died, 1 he 1 had 1 the 1 satisfaction--which 1 few 1 honest 1 solicitors 1 despise--of 1 hi 1 this 1 is 1 tanu 1 kansal 1 hello 1 tanu 1 kansal 1", "0", "26740"], "mapper-8-count-output": ["was 1 wondering 1 what 1 to 1 do 1 with 1 them.\u201d 1 He 1 pointed 1 down-stream. 1 \u201cThey\u2019ve 1 gone.\u201d 1 The 1 river 1 swirled 1 under 1 the 1 bridge, 1 \u201cI 1 did 1 mind 1 them 1 so, 1 and 1 one 1 is 1 so 1 foolish, 1 it 1 seemed 1 better 1 that 1 they 1 should 1 go 1 out 1 to 1 the 1 sea--I 1 don\u2019t 1 know; 1 I 1 may 1 just 1 mean 1 that 1 they 1 frightened 1 me.\u201d 1 Then 1 the 1 boy 1 verged 1 into 1 a 1 man. 1 \u201cFor 1 something 1 tremendous 1 has 1 happened; 1 I 1 must 1 face 1 it 1 without 1 getting 1 muddled. 1 It 1 isn\u2019t 1 exactly 1 that 1 a 1 man 1 has 1 died.\u201d 1 Something 1 warned 1 Lucy 1 that 1 she 1 must 1 stop 1 him. 1 \u201cIt 1 has 1 happened,\u201d 1 he 1 repeated, 1 \u201cand 1 I 1 mean 1 to 1 find 1 out 1 what 1 it 1 is.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson--\u201d 1 He 1 turned 1 towards 1 her 1 frowning, 1 as 1 if 1 she 1 had 1 disturbed 1 him 1 in 1 some 1 abstract 1 quest. 1 \u201cI 1 want 1 to 1 ask 1 you 1 something 1 before 1 we 1 go 1 in.\u201d 1 They 1 were 1 close 1 to 1 their 1 pension. 1 She 1 stopped 1 and 1 leant 1 her 1 elbows 1 against 1 the 1 parapet 1 of 1 the 1 embankment. 1 He 1 did 1 likewise. 1 There 1 is 1 at 1 times 1 a 1 magic 1 in 1 identity 1 of 1 position; 1 it 1 is 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 things 1 that 1 have 1 suggested 1 to 1 us 1 eternal 1 comradeship. 1 She 1 moved 1 her 1 elbows 1 before 1 saying: 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 behaved 1 ridiculously.\u201d 1 He 1 was 1 following 1 his 1 own 1 thoughts. 1 \u201cI 1 was 1 never 1 so 1 much 1 ashamed 1 of 1 myself 1 in 1 my 1 life; 1 I 1 cannot 1 think 1 what 1 came 1 over 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 nearly 1 fainted 1 myself,\u201d 1 he 1 said; 1 but 1 she 1 felt 1 that 1 her 1 attitude 1 repelled 1 him. 1 \u201cWell, 1 I 1 owe 1 you 1 a 1 thousand 1 apologies.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 all 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd--this 1 is 1 the 1 real 1 point--you 1 know 1 how 1 silly 1 people 1 are 1 gossiping--ladies 1 especially, 1 I 1 am 1 afraid--you 1 understand 1 what 1 I 1 mean?\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 afraid 1 I 1 don\u2019t.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 mean, 1 would 1 you 1 not 1 mention 1 it 1 to 1 any 1 one, 1 my 1 foolish 1 behaviour?\u201d 1 \u201cYour 1 behaviour? 1 Oh, 1 yes, 1 all 1 right--all 1 right.\u201d 1 \u201cThank 1 you 1 so 1 much. 1 And 1 would 1 you--\u201d 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 carry 1 her 1 request 1 any 1 further. 1 The 1 river 1 was 1 rushing 1 below 1 them, 1 almost 1 black 1 in 1 the 1 advancing 1 night. 1 He 1 had 1 thrown 1 her 1 photographs 1 into 1 it, 1 and 1 then 1 he 1 had 1 told 1 her 1 the 1 reason. 1 It 1 struck 1 her 1 that 1 it 1 was 1 hopeless 1 to 1 look 1 for 1 chivalry 1 in 1 such 1 a 1 man. 1 He 1 would 1 do 1 her 1 no 1 harm 1 by 1 idle 1 gossip; 1 he 1 was 1 trustworthy, 1 intelligent, 1 and 1 even 1 kind; 1 he 1 might 1 even 1 have 1 a 1 high 1 opinion 1 of 1 her. 1 But 1 he 1 lacked 1 chivalry; 1 his 1 thoughts, 1 like 1 his 1 behaviour, 1 would 1 not 1 be 1 modified 1 by 1 awe. 1 It 1 was 1 useless 1 to 1 say 1 to 1 him, 1 \u201cAnd 1 would 1 you--\u201d 1 and 1 hope 1 that 1 he 1 would 1 complete 1 the 1 sentence 1 for 1 himself, 1 averting 1 his 1 eyes 1 from 1 her 1 nakedness 1 like 1 the 1 knight 1 in 1 that 1 beautiful 1 picture. 1 She 1 had 1 been 1 in 1 his 1 arms, 1 and 1 he 1 remembered 1 it, 1 just 1 as 1 he 1 remembered 1 the 1 blood 1 on 1 the 1 photographs 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 bought 1 in 1 Alinari\u2019s 1 shop. 1 It 1 was 1 not 1 exactly 1 that 1 a 1 man 1 had 1 died; 1 something 1 had 1 happened 1 to 1 the 1 living: 1 they 1 had 1 come 1 to 1 a 1 situation 1 where 1 character 1 tells, 1 and 1 where 1 childhood 1 enters 1 upon 1 the 1 branching 1 paths 1 of 1 Youth. 1 \u201cWell, 1 thank 1 you 1 so 1 much,\u201d 1 she 1 repeated, 1 \u201cHow 1 quickly 1 these 1 accidents 1 do 1 happen, 1 and 1 then 1 one 1 returns 1 to 1 the 1 old 1 life!\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t.\u201d 1 Anxiety 1 moved 1 her 1 to 1 question 1 him. 1 His 1 answer 1 was 1 puzzling: 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 probably 1 want 1 to 1 live.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 why, 1 Mr. 1 Emerson? 1 What 1 do 1 you 1 mean?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 shall 1 want 1 to 1 live, 1 I 1 say.\u201d 1 Leaning 1 her 1 elbows 1 on 1 the 1 parapet, 1 she 1 contemplated 1 the 1 River 1 Arno, 1 whose 1 roar 1 was 1 suggesting 1 some 1 unexpected 1 melody 1 to 1 her 1 ears. 1 Chapter 1 V: 1 Possibilities 1 of 1 a 1 Pleasant 1 Outing 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 family 1 saying 1 that 1 \u201cyou 1 never 1 knew 1 which 1 way 1 Charlotte 1 Bartlett 1 would 1 turn.\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 perfectly 1 pleasant 1 and 1 sensible 1 over 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 adventure, 1 found 1 the 1 abridged 1 account 1 of 1 it 1 quite 1 adequate, 1 and 1 paid 1 suitable 1 tribute 1 to 1 the 1 courtesy 1 of 1 Mr. 1 George 1 Emerson. 1 She 1 and 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 had 1 an 1 adventure 1 also. 1 They 1 had 1 been 1 stopped 1 at 1 the 1 Dazio 1 coming 1 back, 1 and 1 the 1 young 1 officials 1 there, 1 who 1 seemed 1 impudent 1 and 1 desoeuvre, 1 had 1 tried 1 to 1 search 1 their 1 reticules 1 for 1 provisions. 1 It 1 might 1 have 1 been 1 most 1 unpleasant. 1 Fortunately 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 was 1 a 1 match 1 for 1 any 1 one. 1 For 1 good 1 or 1 for 1 evil, 1 Lucy 1 was 1 left 1 to 1 face 1 her 1 problem 1 alone. 1 None 1 of 1 her 1 friends 1 had 1 seen 1 her, 1 either 1 in 1 the 1 Piazza 1 or, 1 later 1 on, 1 by 1 the 1 embankment. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 indeed, 1 noticing 1 her 1 startled 1 eyes 1 at 1 dinner-time, 1 had 1 again 1 passed 1 to 1 himself 1 the 1 remark 1 of 1 \u201cToo 1 much 1 Beethoven.\u201d 1 But 1 he 1 only 1 supposed 1 that 1 she 1 was 1 ready 1 for 1 an 1 adventure, 1 not 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 encountered 1 it. 1 This 1 solitude 1 oppressed 1 her; 1 she 1 was 1 accustomed 1 to 1 have 1 her 1 thoughts 1 confirmed 1 by 1 others 1 or, 1 at 1 all 1 events, 1 contradicted; 1 it 1 was 1 too 1 dreadful 1 not 1 to 1 know 1 whether 1 she 1 was 1 thinking 1 right 1 or 1 wrong. 1 At 1 breakfast 1 next 1 morning 1 she 1 took 1 decisive 1 action. 1 There 1 were 1 two 1 plans 1 between 1 which 1 she 1 had 1 to 1 choose. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 walking 1 up 1 to 1 the 1 Torre 1 del 1 Gallo 1 with 1 the 1 Emersons 1 and 1 some 1 American 1 ladies. 1 Would 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 and 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 join 1 the 1 party? 1 Charlotte 1 declined 1 for 1 herself; 1 she 1 had 1 been 1 there 1 in 1 the 1 rain 1 the 1 previous 1 afternoon. 1 But 1 she 1 thought 1 it 1 an 1 admirable 1 idea 1 for 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 hated 1 shopping, 1 changing 1 money, 1 fetching 1 letters, 1 and 1 other 1 irksome 1 duties--all 1 of 1 which 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 must 1 accomplish 1 this 1 morning 1 and 1 could 1 easily 1 accomplish 1 alone. 1 \u201cNo, 1 Charlotte!\u201d 1 cried 1 the 1 girl, 1 with 1 real 1 warmth. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 very 1 kind 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 but 1 I 1 am 1 certainly 1 coming 1 with 1 you. 1 I 1 had 1 much 1 rather.\u201d 1 \u201cVery 1 well, 1 dear,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 with 1 a 1 faint 1 flush 1 of 1 pleasure 1 that 1 called 1 forth 1 a 1 deep 1 flush 1 of 1 shame 1 on 1 the 1 cheeks 1 of 1 Lucy. 1 How 1 abominably 1 she 1 behaved 1 to 1 Charlotte, 1 now 1 as 1 always! 1 But 1 now 1 she 1 should 1 alter. 1 All 1 morning 1 she 1 would 1 be 1 really 1 nice 1 to 1 her. 1 She 1 slipped 1 her 1 arm 1 into 1 her 1 cousin\u2019s, 1 and 1 they 1 started 1 off 1 along 1 the 1 Lung\u2019 1 Arno. 1 The 1 river 1 was 1 a 1 lion 1 that 1 morning 1 in 1 strength, 1 voice, 1 and 1 colour. 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 insisted 1 on 1 leaning 1 over 1 the 1 parapet 1 to 1 look 1 at 1 it. 1 She 1 then 1 made 1 her 1 usual 1 remark, 1 which 1 was 1 \u201cHow 1 I 1 do 1 wish 1 Freddy 1 and 1 your 1 mother 1 could 1 see 1 this, 1 too!\u201d 1 Lucy 1 fidgeted; 1 it 1 was 1 tiresome 1 of 1 Charlotte 1 to 1 have 1 stopped 1 exactly 1 where 1 she 1 did. 1 \u201cLook, 1 Lucia! 1 Oh, 1 you 1 are 1 watching 1 for 1 the 1 Torre 1 del 1 Gallo 1 party. 1 I 1 feared 1 you 1 would 1 repent 1 you 1 of 1 your 1 choice.\u201d 1 Serious 1 as 1 the 1 choice 1 had 1 been, 1 Lucy 1 did 1 not 1 repent. 1 Yesterday 1 had 1 been 1 a 1 muddle--queer 1 and 1 odd, 1 the 1 kind 1 of 1 thing 1 one 1 could 1 not 1 write 1 down 1 easily 1 on 1 paper--but 1 she 1 had 1 a 1 feeling 1 that 1 Charlotte 1 and 1 her 1 shopping 1 were 1 preferable 1 to 1 George 1 Emerson 1 and 1 the 1 summit 1 of 1 the 1 Torre 1 del 1 Gallo. 1 Since 1 she 1 could 1 not 1 unravel 1 the 1 tangle, 1 she 1 must 1 take 1 care 1 not 1 to 1 re-enter 1 it. 1 She 1 could 1 protest 1 sincerely 1 against 1 Miss 1 Bartlett\u2019s 1 insinuations. 1 But 1 though 1 she 1 had 1 avoided 1 the 1 chief 1 actor, 1 the 1 scenery 1 unfortunately 1 remained. 1 Charlotte, 1 with 1 the 1 complacency 1 of 1 fate, 1 led 1 her 1 from 1 the 1 river 1 to 1 the 1 Piazza 1 Signoria. 1 She 1 could 1 not 1 have 1 believed 1 that 1 stones, 1 a 1 Loggia, 1 a 1 fountain, 1 a 1 palace 1 tower, 1 would 1 have 1 such 1 significance. 1 For 1 a 1 moment 1 she 1 understood 1 the 1 nature 1 of 1 ghosts. 1 The 1 exact 1 site 1 of 1 the 1 murder 1 was 1 occupied, 1 not 1 by 1 a 1 ghost, 1 but 1 by 1 Miss 1 Lavish, 1 who 1 had 1 the 1 morning 1 newspaper 1 in 1 her 1 hand. 1 She 1 hailed 1 them 1 briskly. 1 The 1 dreadful 1 catastrophe 1 of 1 the 1 previous 1 day 1 had 1 given 1 her 1 an 1 idea 1 which 1 she 1 thought 1 would 1 work 1 up 1 into 1 a 1 book. 1 \u201cOh, 1 let 1 me 1 congratulate 1 you!\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cAfter 1 your 1 despair 1 of 1 yesterday! 1 What 1 a 1 fortunate 1 thing!\u201d 1 \u201cAha! 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch, 1 come 1 you 1 here 1 I 1 am 1 in 1 luck. 1 Now, 1 you 1 are 1 to 1 tell 1 me 1 absolutely 1 everything 1 that 1 you 1 saw 1 from 1 the 1 beginning.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 poked 1 at 1 the 1 ground 1 with 1 her 1 parasol. 1 \u201cBut 1 perhaps 1 you 1 would 1 rather 1 not?\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019m 1 sorry--if 1 you 1 could 1 manage 1 without 1 it, 1 I 1 think 1 I 1 would 1 rather 1 not.\u201d 1 The 1 elder 1 ladies 1 exchanged 1 glances, 1 not 1 of 1 disapproval; 1 it 1 is 1 suitable 1 that 1 a 1 girl 1 should 1 feel 1 deeply. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 I 1 who 1 am 1 sorry,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 \u201cliterary 1 hacks 1 are 1 shameless 1 creatures. 1 I 1 believe 1 there\u2019s 1 no 1 secret 1 of 1 the 1 human 1 heart 1 into 1 which 1 we 1 wouldn\u2019t 1 pry.\u201d 1 She 1 marched 1 cheerfully 1 to 1 the 1 fountain 1 and 1 back, 1 and 1 did 1 a 1 few 1 calculations 1 in 1 realism. 1 Then 1 she 1 said 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 been 1 in 1 the 1 Piazza 1 since 1 eight 1 o\u2019clock 1 collecting 1 material. 1 A 1 good 1 deal 1 of 1 it 1 was 1 unsuitable, 1 but 1 of 1 course 1 one 1 always 1 had 1 to 1 adapt. 1 The 1 two 1 men 1 had 1 quarrelled 1 over 1 a 1 five-franc 1 note. 1 For 1 the 1 five-franc 1 note 1 she 1 should 1 substitute 1 a 1 young 1 lady, 1 which 1 would 1 raise 1 the 1 tone 1 of 1 the 1 tragedy, 1 and 1 at 1 the 1 same 1 time 1 furnish 1 an 1 excellent 1 plot. 1 \u201cWhat 1 is 1 the 1 heroine\u2019s 1 name?\u201d 1 asked 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cLeonora,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Lavish; 1 her 1 own 1 name 1 was 1 Eleanor. 1 \u201cI 1 do 1 hope 1 she\u2019s 1 nice.\u201d 1 That 1 desideratum 1 would 1 not 1 be 1 omitted. 1 \u201cAnd 1 what 1 is 1 the 1 plot?\u201d 1 Love, 1 murder, 1 abduction, 1 revenge, 1 was 1 the 1 plot. 1 But 1 it 1 all 1 came 1 while 1 the 1 fountain 1 plashed 1 to 1 the 1 satyrs 1 in 1 the 1 morning 1 sun. 1 \u201cI 1 hope 1 you 1 will 1 excuse 1 me 1 for 1 boring 1 on 1 like 1 this,\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 concluded. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 so 1 tempting 1 to 1 talk 1 to 1 really 1 sympathetic 1 people. 1 Of 1 course, 1 this 1 is 1 the 1 barest 1 outline. 1 There 1 will 1 be 1 a 1 deal 1 of 1 local 1 colouring, 1 descriptions 1 of 1 Florence 1 and 1 the 1 neighbourhood, 1 and 1 I 1 shall 1 also 1 introduce 1 some 1 humorous 1 characters. 1 And 1 let 1 me 1 give 1 you 1 all 1 fair 1 warning: 1 I 1 intend 1 to 1 be 1 unmerciful 1 to 1 the 1 British 1 tourist.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 you 1 wicked 1 woman,\u201d 1 cried 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 sure 1 you 1 are 1 thinking 1 of 1 the 1 Emersons.\u201d 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 gave 1 a 1 Machiavellian 1 smile. 1 \u201cI 1 confess 1 that 1 in 1 Italy 1 my 1 sympathies 1 are 1 not 1 with 1 my 1 own 1 countrymen. 1 It 1 is 1 the 1 neglected 1 Italians 1 who 1 attract 1 me, 1 and 1 whose 1 lives 1 I 1 am 1 going 1 to 1 paint 1 so 1 far 1 as 1 I 1 can. 1 For 1 I 1 repeat 1 and 1 I 1 insist, 1 and 1 I 1 have 1 always 1 held 1 most 1 strongly, 1 that 1 a 1 tragedy 1 such 1 as 1 yesterday\u2019s 1 is 1 not 1 the 1 less 1 tragic 1 because 1 it 1 happened 1 in 1 humble 1 life.\u201d 1 There 1 was 1 a 1 fitting 1 silence 1 when 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 concluded. 1 Then 1 the 1 cousins 1 wished 1 success 1 to 1 her 1 labours, 1 and 1 walked 1 slowly 1 away 1 across 1 the 1 square. 1 \u201cShe 1 is 1 my 1 idea 1 of 1 a 1 really 1 clever 1 woman,\u201d 1 said 1 Miss 1 Bartlett. 1 \u201cThat 1 last 1 remark 1 struck 1 me 1 as 1 so 1 particularly 1 true. 1 It 1 should 1 be 1 a 1 most 1 pathetic 1 novel.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 assented. 1 At 1 present 1 her 1 great 1 aim 1 was 1 not 1 to 1 get 1 put 1 into 1 it. 1 Her 1 perceptions 1 this 1 morning 1 were 1 curiously 1 keen, 1 and 1 she 1 believed 1 that 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 had 1 her 1 on 1 trial 1 for 1 an 1 ingenue. 1 \u201cShe 1 is 1 emancipated, 1 but 1 only 1 in 1 the 1 very 1 best 1 sense 1 of 1 the 1 word,\u201d 1 continued 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 slowly. 1 \u201cNone 1 but 1 the 1 superficial 1 would 1 be 1 shocked 1 at 1 her. 1 We 1 had 1 a 1 long 1 talk 1 yesterday. 1 She 1 believes 1 in 1 justice 1 and 1 truth 1 and 1 human 1 interest. 1 She 1 told 1 me 1 also 1 that 1 she 1 has 1 a 1 high 1 opinion 1 of 1 the 1 destiny 1 hope 1 that 1 Mrs. 1 Harris 1 there 1 warn\u2019t 1 no 1 sich 1 person,\u201d 1 said 1 her 1 mother. 1 Cecil 1 nodded 1 intelligently. 1 \u201cIsn\u2019t 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 a 1 parson 1 of 1 the 1 cultured 1 type?\u201d 1 he 1 asked. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 know. 1 I 1 hate 1 him. 1 I\u2019ve 1 heard 1 him 1 lecture 1 on 1 Giotto. 1 I 1 hate 1 him. 1 Nothing 1 can 1 hide 1 a 1 petty 1 nature. 1 I 1 HATE 1 him.\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 goodness 1 gracious 1 me, 1 child!\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch. 1 \u201cYou\u2019ll 1 blow 1 my 1 head 1 off! 1 Whatever 1 is 1 there 1 to 1 shout 1 over? 1 I 1 forbid 1 you 1 and 1 Cecil 1 to 1 hate 1 any 1 more 1 clergymen.\u201d 1 He 1 smiled. 1 There 1 was 1 indeed 1 something 1 rather 1 incongruous 1 in 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 moral 1 outburst 1 over 1 Mr. 1 Eager. 1 It 1 was 1 as 1 if 1 one 1 should 1 see 1 the 1 Leonardo 1 on 1 the 1 ceiling 1 of 1 the 1 Sistine. 1 He 1 longed 1 to 1 hint 1 to 1 her 1 that 1 not 1 here 1 lay 1 her 1 vocation; 1 that 1 a 1 woman\u2019s 1 power 1 and 1 charm 1 reside 1 in 1 mystery, 1 not 1 in 1 muscular 1 rant. 1 But 1 possibly 1 rant 1 is 1 a 1 sign 1 of 1 vitality: 1 it 1 mars 1 the 1 beautiful 1 creature, 1 but 1 shows 1 that 1 she 1 is 1 alive. 1 After 1 a 1 moment, 1 he 1 contemplated 1 her 1 flushed 1 face 1 and 1 excited 1 gestures 1 with 1 a 1 certain 1 approval. 1 He 1 forebore 1 to 1 repress 1 the 1 sources 1 of 1 youth. 1 Nature--simplest 1 of 1 topics, 1 he 1 thought--lay 1 around 1 them. 1 He 1 praised 1 the 1 pine-woods, 1 the 1 deep 1 lasts 1 of 1 bracken, 1 the 1 crimson 1 leaves 1 that 1 spotted 1 the 1 hurt-bushes, 1 the 1 serviceable 1 beauty 1 of 1 the 1 turnpike 1 road. 1 The 1 outdoor 1 world 1 was 1 not 1 very 1 familiar 1 to 1 him, 1 and 1 occasionally 1 he 1 went 1 wrong 1 in 1 a 1 question 1 of 1 fact. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch\u2019s 1 mouth 1 twitched 1 when 1 he 1 spoke 1 of 1 the 1 perpetual 1 green 1 of 1 the 1 larch. 1 \u201cI 1 count 1 myself 1 a 1 lucky 1 person,\u201d 1 he 1 concluded, 1 \u201cWhen 1 I\u2019m 1 in 1 London 1 I 1 feel 1 I 1 could 1 never 1 live 1 out 1 of 1 it. 1 When 1 I\u2019m 1 in 1 the 1 country 1 I 1 feel 1 the 1 same 1 about 1 the 1 country. 1 After 1 all, 1 I 1 do 1 believe 1 that 1 birds 1 and 1 trees 1 and 1 the 1 sky 1 are 1 the 1 most 1 wonderful 1 things 1 in 1 life, 1 and 1 that 1 the 1 people 1 who 1 live 1 amongst 1 them 1 must 1 be 1 the 1 best. 1 It\u2019s 1 true 1 that 1 in 1 nine 1 cases 1 out 1 of 1 ten 1 they 1 don\u2019t 1 seem 1 to 1 notice 1 anything. 1 The 1 country 1 gentleman 1 and 1 the 1 country 1 labourer 1 are 1 each 1 in 1 their 1 way 1 the 1 most 1 depressing 1 of 1 companions. 1 Yet 1 they 1 may 1 have 1 a 1 tacit 1 sympathy 1 with 1 the 1 workings 1 of 1 Nature 1 which 1 is 1 denied 1 to 1 us 1 of 1 the 1 town. 1 Do 1 you 1 feel 1 that, 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch?\u201d 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 started 1 and 1 smiled. 1 She 1 had 1 not 1 been 1 attending. 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 was 1 rather 1 crushed 1 on 1 the 1 front 1 seat 1 of 1 the 1 victoria, 1 felt 1 irritable, 1 and 1 determined 1 not 1 to 1 say 1 anything 1 interesting 1 again. 1 Lucy 1 had 1 not 1 attended 1 either. 1 Her 1 brow 1 was 1 wrinkled, 1 and 1 she 1 still 1 looked 1 furiously 1 cross--the 1 result, 1 he 1 concluded, 1 of 1 too 1 much 1 moral 1 gymnastics. 1 It 1 was 1 sad 1 to 1 see 1 her 1 thus 1 blind 1 to 1 the 1 beauties 1 of 1 an 1 August 1 wood. 1 \u201c\u2018Come 1 down, 1 O 1 maid, 1 from 1 yonder 1 mountain 1 height,\u2019\u201d 1 he 1 quoted, 1 and 1 touched 1 her 1 knee 1 with 1 his 1 own. 1 She 1 flushed 1 again 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cWhat 1 height?\u201d 1 \u201c\u2018Come 1 down, 1 O 1 maid, 1 from 1 yonder 1 mountain 1 height, 1 What 1 pleasure 1 lives 1 in 1 height 1 (the 1 shepherd 1 sang). 1 In 1 height 1 and 1 in 1 the 1 splendour 1 of 1 the 1 hills?\u2019 1 Let 1 us 1 take 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch\u2019s 1 advice 1 and 1 hate 1 clergymen 1 no 1 more. 1 What\u2019s 1 this 1 place?\u201d 1 \u201cSummer 1 Street, 1 of 1 course,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 roused 1 herself. 1 The 1 woods 1 had 1 opened 1 to 1 leave 1 space 1 for 1 a 1 sloping 1 triangular 1 meadow. 1 Pretty 1 cottages 1 lined 1 it 1 on 1 two 1 sides, 1 and 1 the 1 upper 1 and 1 third 1 side 1 was 1 occupied 1 by 1 a 1 new 1 stone 1 church, 1 expensively 1 simple, 1 a 1 charming 1 shingled 1 spire. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 house 1 was 1 near 1 the 1 church. 1 In 1 height 1 it 1 scarcely 1 exceeded 1 the 1 cottages. 1 Some 1 great 1 mansions 1 were 1 at 1 hand, 1 but 1 they 1 were 1 hidden 1 in 1 the 1 trees. 1 The 1 scene 1 suggested 1 a 1 Swiss 1 Alp 1 rather 1 than 1 the 1 shrine 1 and 1 centre 1 of 1 a 1 leisured 1 world, 1 and 1 was 1 marred 1 only 1 by 1 two 1 ugly 1 little 1 villas--the 1 villas 1 that 1 had 1 competed 1 with 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 engagement, 1 having 1 been 1 acquired 1 by 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway 1 the 1 very 1 afternoon 1 that 1 Lucy 1 had 1 been 1 acquired 1 by 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cCissie\u201d 1 was 1 the 1 name 1 of 1 one 1 of 1 these 1 villas, 1 \u201cAlbert\u201d 1 of 1 the 1 other. 1 These 1 titles 1 were 1 not 1 only 1 picked 1 out 1 in 1 shaded 1 Gothic 1 on 1 the 1 garden 1 gates, 1 but 1 appeared 1 a 1 second 1 time 1 on 1 the 1 porches, 1 where 1 they 1 followed 1 the 1 semicircular 1 curve 1 of 1 the 1 entrance 1 arch 1 in 1 block 1 capitals. 1 \u201cAlbert\u201d 1 was 1 inhabited. 1 His 1 tortured 1 garden 1 was 1 bright 1 with 1 geraniums 1 and 1 lobelias 1 and 1 polished 1 shells. 1 His 1 little 1 windows 1 were 1 chastely 1 swathed 1 in 1 Nottingham 1 lace. 1 \u201cCissie\u201d 1 was 1 to 1 let. 1 Three 1 notice-boards, 1 belonging 1 to 1 Dorking 1 agents, 1 lolled 1 on 1 her 1 fence 1 and 1 announced 1 the 1 not 1 surprising 1 fact. 1 Her 1 paths 1 were 1 already 1 weedy; 1 her 1 pocket-handkerchief 1 of 1 a 1 lawn 1 was 1 yellow 1 with 1 dandelions. 1 \u201cThe 1 place 1 is 1 ruined!\u201d 1 said 1 the 1 ladies 1 mechanically. 1 \u201cSummer 1 Street 1 will 1 never 1 be 1 the 1 same 1 again.\u201d 1 As 1 the 1 carriage 1 passed, 1 \u201cCissie\u2019s\u201d 1 door 1 opened, 1 and 1 a 1 gentleman 1 came 1 out 1 of 1 her. 1 \u201cStop!\u201d 1 cried 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 touching 1 the 1 coachman 1 with 1 her 1 parasol. 1 \u201cHere\u2019s 1 Sir 1 Harry. 1 Now 1 we 1 shall 1 know. 1 Sir 1 Harry, 1 pull 1 those 1 things 1 down 1 at 1 once!\u201d 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway--who 1 need 1 not 1 be 1 described--came 1 to 1 the 1 carriage 1 and 1 said 1 \u201cMrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 I 1 meant 1 to. 1 I 1 can\u2019t, 1 I 1 really 1 can\u2019t 1 turn 1 out 1 Miss 1 Flack.\u201d 1 \u201cAm 1 I 1 not 1 always 1 right? 1 She 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 gone 1 before 1 the 1 contract 1 was 1 signed. 1 Does 1 she 1 still 1 live 1 rent 1 free, 1 as 1 she 1 did 1 in 1 her 1 nephew\u2019s 1 time?\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 what 1 can 1 I 1 do?\u201d 1 He 1 lowered 1 his 1 voice. 1 \u201cAn 1 old 1 lady, 1 so 1 very 1 vulgar, 1 and 1 almost 1 bedridden.\u201d 1 \u201cTurn 1 her 1 out,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil 1 bravely. 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 sighed, 1 and 1 looked 1 at 1 the 1 villas 1 mournfully. 1 He 1 had 1 had 1 full 1 warning 1 of 1 Mr. 1 Flack\u2019s 1 intentions, 1 and 1 might 1 have 1 bought 1 the 1 plot 1 before 1 building 1 commenced: 1 but 1 he 1 was 1 apathetic 1 and 1 dilatory. 1 He 1 had 1 known 1 Summer 1 Street 1 for 1 so 1 many 1 years 1 that 1 he 1 could 1 not 1 imagine 1 it 1 being 1 spoilt. 1 Not 1 till 1 Mrs. 1 Flack 1 had 1 laid 1 the 1 foundation 1 stone, 1 and 1 the 1 apparition 1 of 1 red 1 and 1 cream 1 brick 1 began 1 to 1 rise 1 did 1 he 1 take 1 alarm. 1 He 1 called 1 on 1 Mr. 1 Flack, 1 the 1 local 1 builder,--a 1 most 1 reasonable 1 and 1 respectful 1 man--who 1 agreed 1 that 1 tiles 1 would 1 have 1 made 1 more 1 artistic 1 roof, 1 but 1 pointed 1 out 1 that 1 slates 1 were 1 cheaper. 1 He 1 ventured 1 to 1 differ, 1 however, 1 about 1 the 1 Corinthian 1 columns 1 which 1 were 1 to 1 cling 1 like 1 leeches 1 to 1 the 1 frames 1 of 1 the 1 bow 1 windows, 1 saying 1 that, 1 for 1 his 1 part, 1 he 1 liked 1 to 1 relieve 1 the 1 facade 1 by 1 a 1 bit 1 of 1 decoration. 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 hinted 1 that 1 a 1 column, 1 if 1 possible, 1 should 1 be 1 structural 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 decorative. 1 Mr. 1 Flack 1 replied 1 that 1 all 1 the 1 columns 1 had 1 been 1 ordered, 1 adding, 1 \u201cand 1 all 1 the 1 capitals 1 different--one 1 with 1 dragons 1 in 1 the 1 foliage, 1 another 1 approaching 1 to 1 the 1 Ionian 1 style, 1 another 1 introducing 1 Mrs. 1 Flack\u2019s 1 initials--everyone 1 different.\u201d 1 For 1 he 1 had 1 read 1 his 1 Ruskin. 1 He 1 built 1 his 1 villas 1 according 1 to 1 his 1 desire; 1 and 1 not 1 until 1 he 1 had 1 inserted 1 an 1 immovable 1 aunt 1 into 1 one 1 of 1 them 1 did 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 buy. 1 This 1 futile 1 and 1 unprofitable 1 transaction 1 filled 1 the 1 knight 1 with 1 sadness 1 as 1 he 1 leant 1 on 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch\u2019s 1 carriage. 1 He 1 had 1 failed 1 in 1 his 1 duties 1 to 1 the 1 country-side, 1 and 1 the 1 country-side 1 was 1 laughing 1 at 1 him 1 as 1 well. 1 He 1 had 1 spent 1 money, 1 and 1 yet 1 Summer 1 Street 1 was 1 spoilt 1 as 1 much 1 as 1 ever. 1 All 1 he 1 could 1 do 1 now 1 was 1 to 1 find 1 a 1 desirable 1 tenant 1 for 1 \u201cCissie\u201d--some 1 one 1 really 1 desirable. 1 \u201cThe 1 rent 1 is 1 absurdly 1 low,\u201d 1 he 1 told 1 them, 1 \u201cand 1 perhaps 1 I 1 am 1 an 1 easy 1 landlord. 1 But 1 it 1 is 1 such 1 an 1 awkward 1 size. 1 It 1 is 1 too 1 large 1 for 1 the 1 peasant 1 class 1 and 1 too 1 small 1 for 1 any 1 one 1 the 1 least 1 like 1 ourselves.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 had 1 been 1 hesitating 1 whether 1 he 1 should 1 despise 1 the 1 villas 1 or 1 despise 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 for 1 despising 1 them. 1 The 1 latter 1 impulse 1 seemed 1 the 1 more 1 fruitful. 1 \u201cYou 1 ought 1 to 1 find 1 a 1 tenant 1 at 1 once,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 maliciously. 1 \u201cIt 1 would 1 be 1 a 1 perfect 1 paradise 1 for 1 a 1 bank 1 clerk.\u201d 1 \u201cExactly!\u201d 1 said 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 excitedly. 1 \u201cThat 1 is 1 exactly 1 what 1 I 1 fear, 1 Mr. 1 Vyse. 1 It 1 will 1 attract 1 the 1 wrong 1 type 1 of 1 people. 1 The 1 train 1 service 1 has 1 improved--a 1 fatal 1 improvement, 1 to 1 my 1 mind. 1 And 1 what 1 are 1 five 1 miles 1 from 1 a 1 station 1 in 1 these 1 days 1 of 1 bicycles?\u201d 1 \u201cRather 1 a 1 strenuous 1 clerk 1 it 1 would 1 be,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy. 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 had 1 his 1 full 1 share 1 of 1 mediaeval 1 mischievousness, 1 replied 1 that 1 the 1 physique 1 of 1 the 1 lower 1 middle 1 classes 1 was 1 improving 1 at 1 a 1 most 1 appalling 1 rate. 1 She 1 saw 1 that 1 he 1 was 1 laughing 1 at 1 their 1 harmless 1 neighbour, 1 and 1 roused 1 herself 1 to 1 stop 1 him. 1 \u201cSir 1 Harry!\u201d 1 she 1 exclaimed, 1 \u201cI 1 have 1 an 1 idea. 1 How 1 would 1 you 1 like 1 spinsters?\u201d 1 \u201cMy 1 dear 1 Lucy, 1 it 1 would 1 be 1 splendid. 1 Do 1 you 1 know 1 any 1 such?\u201d 1 \u201cYes; 1 I 1 met 1 them 1 abroad.\u201d 1 \u201cGentlewomen?\u201d 1 he 1 asked 1 tentatively. 1 \u201cYes, 1 indeed, 1 and 1 at 1 the 1 present 1 moment 1 homeless. 1 I 1 heard 1 from 1 them 1 last 1 week--Miss 1 Teresa 1 and 1 Miss 1 Catharine 1 Alan. 1 I\u2019m 1 really 1 not 1 joking. 1 They 1 are 1 quite 1 the 1 right 1 people. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 knows 1 them, 1 too. 1 May 1 I 1 tell 1 them 1 to 1 write 1 to 1 you?\u201d 1 \u201cIndeed 1 you 1 may!\u201d 1 he 1 cried. 1 \u201cHere 1 we 1 are 1 with 1 the 1 difficulty 1 solved 1 already. 1 How 1 delightful 1 it 1 is! 1 Extra 1 facilities--please 1 tell 1 them 1 they 1 shall 1 have 1 extra 1 facilities, 1 for 1 I 1 shall 1 have 1 no 1 agents\u2019 1 fees. 1 Oh, 1 the 1 agents! 1 The 1 appalling 1 people 1 they 1 have 1 sent 1 me! 1 One 1 woman, 1 when 1 I 1 wrote--a 1 tactful 1 letter, 1 you 1 know--asking 1 her 1 to 1 explain 1 her 1 social 1 position 1 to 1 me, 1 replied 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 pay 1 the 1 rent 1 in 1 advance. 1 As 1 if 1 one 1 cares 1 about 1 that! 1 And 1 several 1 references 1 I 1 took 1 up 1 were 1 most 1 unsatisfactory--people 1 swindlers, 1 or 1 not 1 respectable. 1 And 1 oh, 1 the 1 deceit! 1 I 1 have 1 seen 1 a 1 good 1 deal 1 of 1 the 1 seamy 1 side 1 this 1 last 1 week. 1 The 1 deceit 1 of 1 the 1 most 1 promising 1 people. 1 My 1 dear 1 Lucy, 1 the 1 deceit!\u201d 1 She 1 nodded. 1 \u201cMy 1 advice,\u201d 1 put 1 in 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 \u201cis 1 to 1 have 1 nothing 1 to 1 do 1 with 1 Lucy 1 and 1 her 1 decayed 1 gentlewomen 1 at 1 all. 1 I 1 know 1 the 1 type. 1 Preserve 1 me 1 from 1 people 1 who 1 have 1 seen 1 better 1 days, 1 and 1 bring 1 heirlooms 1 with 1 them 1 that 1 make 1 the 1 house 1 smell 1 stuffy. 1 It\u2019s 1 a 1 sad 1 thing, 1 but 1 I\u2019d 1 far 1 rather 1 let 1 to 1 someone 1 who 1 is 1 going 1 up 1 in 1 the 1 world 1 than 1 to 1 someone 1 who 1 has 1 come 1 down.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 think 1 I 1 follow 1 you,\u201d 1 said 1 Sir 1 Harry; 1 \u201cbut 1 it 1 is, 1 as 1 you 1 say, 1 a 1 very 1 sad 1 thing.\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 Misses 1 Alan 1 aren\u2019t 1 that!\u201d 1 cried 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cYes, 1 they 1 are,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil. 1 \u201cI 1 haven\u2019t 1 met 1 them 1 but 1 I 1 should 1 say 1 they 1 were 1 a 1 highly 1 unsuitable 1 addition 1 to 1 the 1 neighbourhood.\u201d 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 listen 1 to 1 him, 1 Sir 1 Harry--he\u2019s 1 tiresome.\u201d 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 I 1 who 1 am 1 tiresome,\u201d 1 he 1 replied. 1 \u201cI 1 oughtn\u2019t 1 to 1 come 1 with 1 my 1 troubles 1 to 1 young 1 people. 1 But 1 really 1 I 1 am 1 so 1 worried, 1 and 1 Lady 1 Otway 1 will 1 only 1 say 1 that 1 I 1 cannot 1 be 1 too 1 careful, 1 which 1 is 1 quite 1 true, 1 but 1 no 1 real 1 help.\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 may 1 I 1 write 1 to 1 my 1 Misses 1 Alan?\u201d 1 \u201cPlease!\u201d 1 But 1 his 1 never 1 been 1 with 1 her? 1 To-day, 1 I 1 believe 1 that 1 we 1 must 1 discover 1 Nature. 1 After 1 many 1 conquests 1 we 1 shall 1 attain 1 simplicity. 1 It 1 is 1 our 1 heritage.\u201d 1 \u201cLet 1 me 1 introduce 1 Mr. 1 Honeychurch, 1 whose 1 sister 1 you 1 will 1 remember 1 at 1 Florence.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 do 1 you 1 do? 1 Very 1 glad 1 to 1 see 1 you, 1 and 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 taking 1 George 1 for 1 a 1 bathe. 1 Very 1 glad 1 to 1 hear 1 that 1 your 1 sister 1 is 1 going 1 to 1 marry. 1 Marriage 1 is 1 a 1 duty. 1 I 1 am 1 sure 1 that 1 she 1 will 1 be 1 happy, 1 for 1 we 1 know 1 Mr. 1 Vyse, 1 too. 1 He 1 has 1 been 1 most 1 kind. 1 He 1 met 1 us 1 by 1 chance 1 in 1 the 1 National 1 Gallery, 1 and 1 arranged 1 everything 1 about 1 this 1 delightful 1 house. 1 Though 1 I 1 hope 1 I 1 have 1 not 1 vexed 1 Sir 1 Harry 1 Otway. 1 I 1 have 1 met 1 so 1 few 1 Liberal 1 landowners, 1 and 1 I 1 was 1 anxious 1 to 1 compare 1 his 1 attitude 1 towards 1 the 1 game 1 laws 1 with 1 the 1 Conservative 1 attitude. 1 Ah, 1 this 1 wind! 1 You 1 do 1 well 1 to 1 bathe. 1 Yours 1 is 1 a 1 glorious 1 country, 1 Honeychurch!\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 a 1 bit!\u201d 1 mumbled 1 Freddy. 1 \u201cI 1 must--that 1 is 1 to 1 say, 1 I 1 have 1 to--have 1 the 1 pleasure 1 of 1 calling 1 on 1 you 1 later 1 on, 1 my 1 mother 1 says, 1 I 1 hope.\u201d 1 \u201cCALL, 1 my 1 lad? 1 Who 1 taught 1 us 1 that 1 drawing-room 1 twaddle? 1 Call 1 on 1 your 1 grandmother! 1 Listen 1 to 1 the 1 wind 1 among 1 the 1 pines! 1 Yours 1 is 1 a 1 glorious 1 country.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 came 1 to 1 the 1 rescue. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson, 1 he 1 will 1 call, 1 I 1 shall 1 call; 1 you 1 or 1 your 1 son 1 will 1 return 1 our 1 calls 1 before 1 ten 1 days 1 have 1 elapsed. 1 I 1 trust 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 realized 1 about 1 the 1 ten 1 days\u2019 1 interval. 1 It 1 does 1 not 1 count 1 that 1 I 1 helped 1 you 1 with 1 the 1 stair-eyes 1 yesterday. 1 It 1 does 1 not 1 count 1 that 1 they 1 are 1 going 1 to 1 bathe 1 this 1 afternoon.\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 go 1 and 1 bathe, 1 George. 1 Why 1 do 1 you 1 dawdle 1 talking? 1 Bring 1 them 1 back 1 to 1 tea. 1 Bring 1 back 1 some 1 milk, 1 cakes, 1 honey. 1 The 1 change 1 will 1 do 1 you 1 good. 1 George 1 has 1 been 1 working 1 very 1 hard 1 at 1 his 1 office. 1 I 1 can\u2019t 1 believe 1 he\u2019s 1 well.\u201d 1 George 1 bowed 1 his 1 head, 1 dusty 1 and 1 sombre, 1 exhaling 1 the 1 peculiar 1 smell 1 of 1 one 1 who 1 has 1 handled 1 furniture. 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 really 1 want 1 this 1 bathe?\u201d 1 Freddy 1 asked 1 him. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 only 1 a 1 pond, 1 don\u2019t 1 you 1 know. 1 I 1 dare 1 say 1 you 1 are 1 used 1 to 1 something 1 better.\u201d 1 \u201cYes--I 1 have 1 said 1 \u2018Yes\u2019 1 already.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 felt 1 bound 1 to 1 assist 1 his 1 young 1 friend, 1 and 1 led 1 the 1 way 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 house 1 and 1 into 1 the 1 pine-woods. 1 How 1 glorious 1 it 1 was! 1 For 1 a 1 little 1 time 1 the 1 voice 1 of 1 old 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 pursued 1 them 1 dispensing 1 good 1 wishes 1 and 1 philosophy. 1 It 1 ceased, 1 and 1 they 1 only 1 heard 1 the 1 fair 1 wind 1 blowing 1 the 1 bracken 1 and 1 the 1 trees. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 who 1 could 1 be 1 silent, 1 but 1 who 1 could 1 not 1 bear 1 silence, 1 was 1 compelled 1 to 1 chatter, 1 since 1 the 1 expedition 1 looked 1 like 1 a 1 failure, 1 and 1 neither 1 of 1 his 1 companions 1 would 1 utter 1 a 1 word. 1 He 1 spoke 1 of 1 Florence. 1 George 1 attended 1 gravely, 1 assenting 1 or 1 dissenting 1 with 1 slight 1 but 1 determined 1 gestures 1 that 1 were 1 as 1 inexplicable 1 as 1 the 1 motions 1 of 1 the 1 tree-tops 1 above 1 their 1 heads. 1 \u201cAnd 1 what 1 a 1 coincidence 1 that 1 you 1 should 1 meet 1 Mr. 1 Vyse! 1 Did 1 you 1 realize 1 that 1 you 1 would 1 find 1 all 1 the 1 Pension 1 Bertolini 1 down 1 here?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 did 1 not. 1 Miss 1 Lavish 1 told 1 me.\u201d 1 \u201cWhen 1 I 1 was 1 a 1 young 1 man, 1 I 1 always 1 meant 1 to 1 write 1 a 1 \u2018History 1 of 1 Coincidence.\u2019\u201d 1 No 1 enthusiasm. 1 \u201cThough, 1 as 1 a 1 matter 1 of 1 fact, 1 coincidences 1 are 1 much 1 rarer 1 than 1 we 1 suppose. 1 For 1 example, 1 it 1 isn\u2019t 1 purely 1 coincidentally 1 that 1 you 1 are 1 here 1 now, 1 when 1 one 1 comes 1 to 1 reflect.\u201d 1 To 1 his 1 relief, 1 George 1 began 1 to 1 talk. 1 \u201cIt 1 is. 1 I 1 have 1 reflected. 1 It 1 is 1 Fate. 1 Everything 1 is 1 Fate. 1 We 1 are 1 flung 1 together 1 by 1 Fate, 1 drawn 1 apart 1 by 1 Fate--flung 1 together, 1 drawn 1 apart. 1 The 1 twelve 1 winds 1 blow 1 us--we 1 settle 1 nothing--\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 have 1 not 1 reflected 1 at 1 all,\u201d 1 rapped 1 the 1 clergyman. 1 \u201cLet 1 me 1 give 1 you 1 a 1 useful 1 tip, 1 Emerson: 1 attribute 1 nothing 1 to 1 Fate. 1 Don\u2019t 1 say, 1 \u2018I 1 didn\u2019t 1 do 1 this,\u2019 1 for 1 you 1 did 1 it, 1 ten 1 to 1 one. 1 Now 1 I\u2019ll 1 cross-question 1 you. 1 Where 1 did 1 you 1 first 1 meet 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 and 1 myself?\u201d 1 \u201cItaly.\u201d 1 \u201cAnd 1 where 1 did 1 you 1 meet 1 Mr. 1 Vyse, 1 who 1 is 1 going 1 to 1 marry 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch?\u201d 1 \u201cNational 1 Gallery.\u201d 1 \u201cLooking 1 at 1 Italian 1 art. 1 There 1 you 1 are, 1 and 1 yet 1 you 1 talk 1 of 1 coincidence 1 and 1 Fate. 1 You 1 naturally 1 seek 1 out 1 things 1 Italian, 1 and 1 so 1 do 1 we 1 and 1 our 1 friends. 1 This 1 narrows 1 the 1 field 1 immeasurably 1 we 1 meet 1 again 1 in 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 Fate 1 that 1 I 1 am 1 here,\u201d 1 persisted 1 George. 1 \u201cBut 1 you 1 can 1 call 1 it 1 Italy 1 if 1 it 1 makes 1 you 1 less 1 unhappy.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 slid 1 away 1 from 1 such 1 heavy 1 treatment 1 of 1 the 1 subject. 1 But 1 he 1 was 1 infinitely 1 tolerant 1 of 1 the 1 young, 1 and 1 had 1 no 1 desire 1 to 1 snub 1 George. 1 \u201cAnd 1 so 1 for 1 this 1 and 1 for 1 other 1 reasons 1 my 1 \u2018History 1 of 1 Coincidence\u2019 1 is 1 still 1 to 1 write.\u201d 1 Silence. 1 Wishing 1 to 1 round 1 off 1 the 1 episode, 1 he 1 added; 1 \u201cWe 1 are 1 all 1 so 1 glad 1 that 1 you 1 have 1 come.\u201d 1 Silence. 1 \u201cHere 1 we 1 are!\u201d 1 called 1 Freddy. 1 \u201cOh, 1 good!\u201d 1 exclaimed 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 mopping 1 his 1 brow. 1 \u201cIn 1 there\u2019s 1 the 1 pond. 1 I 1 wish 1 it 1 was 1 bigger,\u201d 1 he 1 added 1 apologetically. 1 They 1 climbed 1 down 1 a 1 slippery 1 bank 1 of 1 pine-needles. 1 There 1 lay 1 the 1 pond, 1 set 1 in 1 its 1 little 1 alp 1 of 1 green--only 1 a 1 pond, 1 but 1 large 1 enough 1 to 1 contain 1 the 1 human 1 body, 1 and 1 pure 1 enough 1 to 1 reflect 1 the 1 sky. 1 On 1 account 1 of 1 the 1 rains, 1 the 1 waters 1 had 1 flooded 1 the 1 surrounding 1 grass, 1 which 1 showed 1 like 1 a 1 beautiful 1 emerald 1 path, 1 tempting 1 these 1 feet 1 towards 1 the 1 central 1 pool. 1 \u201cIt\u2019s 1 distinctly 1 successful, 1 as 1 ponds 1 go,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cNo 1 apologies 1 are 1 necessary 1 for 1 the 1 pond.\u201d 1 George 1 sat 1 down 1 where 1 the 1 ground 1 was 1 dry, 1 and 1 drearily 1 unlaced 1 his 1 boots. 1 \u201cAren\u2019t 1 those 1 masses 1 of 1 willow-herb 1 splendid? 1 I 1 love 1 willow-herb 1 in 1 seed. 1 What\u2019s 1 the 1 name 1 of 1 this 1 aromatic 1 plant?\u201d 1 No 1 one 1 knew, 1 or 1 seemed 1 to 1 care. 1 \u201cThese 1 abrupt 1 changes 1 of 1 vegetation--this 1 little 1 spongeous 1 tract 1 of 1 water 1 plants, 1 and 1 on 1 either 1 side 1 of 1 it 1 all 1 the 1 growths 1 are 1 tough 1 or 1 brittle--heather, 1 bracken, 1 hurts, 1 pines. 1 Very 1 charming, 1 very 1 charming.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe, 1 aren\u2019t 1 you 1 bathing?\u201d 1 called 1 Freddy, 1 as 1 he 1 stripped 1 himself. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 thought 1 he 1 was 1 not. 1 \u201cWater\u2019s 1 wonderful!\u201d 1 cried 1 Freddy, 1 prancing 1 in. 1 \u201cWater\u2019s 1 water,\u201d 1 murmured 1 George. 1 Wetting 1 his 1 hair 1 first--a 1 sure 1 sign 1 of 1 apathy--he 1 followed 1 Freddy 1 into 1 the 1 divine, 1 as 1 indifferent 1 as 1 if 1 he 1 were 1 a 1 statue 1 and 1 the 1 pond 1 a 1 pail 1 of 1 soapsuds. 1 It 1 was 1 necessary 1 to 1 use 1 his 1 muscles. 1 It 1 was 1 necessary 1 to 1 keep 1 clean. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 watched 1 them, 1 and 1 watched 1 the 1 seeds 1 of 1 the 1 willow-herb 1 dance 1 chorically 1 above 1 their 1 heads. 1 \u201cApooshoo, 1 apooshoo, 1 apooshoo,\u201d 1 went 1 Freddy, 1 swimming 1 for 1 two 1 strokes 1 in 1 either 1 direction, 1 and 1 then 1 becoming 1 involved 1 in 1 reeds 1 or 1 mud. 1 \u201cIs 1 it 1 worth 1 it?\u201d 1 asked 1 the 1 other, 1 Michelangelesque 1 on 1 the 1 flooded 1 margin. 1 The 1 bank 1 broke 1 away, 1 and 1 he 1 fell 1 into 1 the 1 pool 1 before 1 he 1 had 1 weighed 1 the 1 question 1 properly. 1 \u201cHee-poof--I\u2019ve 1 swallowed 1 a 1 pollywog, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 water\u2019s 1 wonderful, 1 water\u2019s 1 simply 1 ripping.\u201d 1 \u201cWater\u2019s 1 not 1 so 1 bad,\u201d 1 said 1 George, 1 reappearing 1 from 1 his 1 plunge, 1 and 1 sputtering 1 at 1 the 1 sun. 1 \u201cWater\u2019s 1 wonderful. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 do.\u201d 1 \u201cApooshoo, 1 kouf.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 who 1 was 1 hot, 1 and 1 who 1 always 1 acquiesced 1 where 1 possible, 1 looked 1 around 1 him. 1 He 1 could 1 detect 1 no 1 parishioners 1 except 1 the 1 pine-trees, 1 rising 1 up 1 steeply 1 on 1 all 1 sides, 1 and 1 gesturing 1 to 1 each 1 other 1 against 1 the 1 blue. 1 How 1 glorious 1 it 1 was! 1 The 1 world 1 of 1 motor-cars 1 and 1 rural 1 Deans 1 receded 1 inimitably. 1 Water, 1 sky, 1 evergreens, 1 a 1 wind--these 1 things 1 not 1 even 1 the 1 seasons 1 can 1 touch, 1 and 1 surely 1 they 1 lie 1 beyond 1 the 1 intrusion 1 of 1 man? 1 \u201cI 1 may 1 as 1 well 1 wash 1 too\u201d; 1 and 1 soon 1 his 1 garments 1 made 1 a 1 third 1 little 1 pile 1 on 1 the 1 sward, 1 and 1 he 1 too 1 asserted 1 the 1 wonder 1 of 1 the 1 water. 1 It 1 was 1 ordinary 1 water, 1 nor 1 was 1 there 1 very 1 much 1 of 1 it, 1 and, 1 as 1 Freddy 1 said, 1 it 1 reminded 1 one 1 of 1 swimming 1 in 1 a 1 salad. 1 The 1 three 1 gentlemen 1 rotated 1 in 1 the 1 pool 1 breast 1 high, 1 after 1 the 1 fashion 1 of 1 the 1 nymphs 1 in 1 Gotterdammerung. 1 But 1 either 1 because 1 the 1 rains 1 had 1 given 1 a 1 freshness 1 or 1 because 1 the 1 sun 1 was 1 shedding 1 a 1 most 1 glorious 1 heat, 1 or 1 because 1 two 1 of 1 the 1 gentlemen 1 were 1 young 1 in 1 years 1 and 1 the 1 third 1 young 1 in 1 spirit--for 1 some 1 reason 1 or 1 other 1 a 1 change 1 came 1 over 1 them, 1 and 1 they 1 forgot 1 Italy 1 and 1 Botany 1 and 1 Fate. 1 They 1 began 1 to 1 play. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 and 1 Freddy 1 splashed 1 each 1 other. 1 A 1 little 1 deferentially, 1 they 1 splashed 1 George. 1 He 1 was 1 quiet: 1 they 1 feared 1 they 1 had 1 offended 1 him. 1 Then 1 all 1 the 1 forces 1 of 1 youth 1 burst 1 out. 1 He 1 smiled, 1 flung 1 himself 1 at 1 them, 1 splashed 1 them, 1 ducked 1 them, 1 kicked 1 them, 1 muddied 1 them, 1 and 1 drove 1 them 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 pool. 1 \u201cRace 1 you 1 round 1 it, 1 then,\u201d 1 cried 1 Freddy, 1 and 1 they 1 raced 1 in 1 the 1 sunshine, 1 and 1 George 1 took 1 a 1 short 1 cut 1 and 1 dirtied 1 his 1 shins, 1 and 1 had 1 to 1 bathe 1 a 1 second 1 time. 1 Then 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 consented 1 to 1 run--a 1 memorable 1 sight. 1 They 1 ran 1 to 1 get 1 dry, 1 they 1 bathed 1 to 1 get 1 cool, 1 they 1 played 1 at 1 being 1 Indians 1 in 1 the 1 willow-herbs 1 and 1 in 1 the 1 bracken, 1 they 1 bathed 1 to 1 get 1 clean. 1 And 1 all 1 the 1 time 1 three 1 little 1 bundles 1 lay 1 discreetly 1 on 1 the 1 sward, 1 proclaiming: 1 \u201cNo. 1 We 1 are 1 what 1 matters. 1 Without 1 us 1 shall 1 no 1 enterprise 1 begin. 1 To 1 us 1 shall 1 all 1 flesh 1 turn 1 in 1 the 1 end.\u201d 1 \u201cA 1 try! 1 A 1 try!\u201d 1 yelled 1 Freddy, 1 snatching 1 up 1 George\u2019s 1 bundle 1 and 1 placing 1 it 1 beside 1 an 1 imaginary 1 goal-post. 1 \u201cSocker 1 rules,\u201d 1 George 1 retorted, 1 scattering 1 Freddy\u2019s 1 bundle 1 with 1 a 1 kick. 1 \u201cGoal!\u201d 1 \u201cGoal!\u201d 1 \u201cPass!\u201d 1 \u201cTake 1 care 1 my 1 watch!\u201d 1 cried 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 Clothes 1 flew 1 in 1 all 1 directions. 1 \u201cTake 1 care 1 my 1 hat! 1 No, 1 that\u2019s 1 enough, 1 Freddy. 1 Dress 1 now. 1 No, 1 I 1 say!\u201d 1 But 1 the 1 two 1 young 1 men 1 were 1 delirious. 1 Away 1 they 1 twinkled 1 into 1 the 1 trees, 1 Freddy 1 with 1 a 1 clerical 1 waistcoat 1 under 1 his 1 arm, 1 George 1 with 1 a 1 wide-awake 1 hat 1 on 1 his 1 dripping 1 hair. 1 \u201cThat\u2019ll 1 do!\u201d 1 shouted 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 remembering 1 that 1 after 1 all 1 he 1 was 1 in 1 his 1 own 1 parish. 1 Then 1 his 1 voice 1 changed 1 as 1 if 1 every 1 pine-tree 1 was 1 a 1 Rural 1 Dean. 1 \u201cHi! 1 Steady 1 on! 1 I 1 see 1 people 1 coming 1 you 1 fellows!\u201d 1 Yells, 1 and 1 widening 1 circles 1 over 1 the 1 dappled 1 earth. 1 \u201cHi! 1 hi! 1 LADIES!\u201d 1 Neither 1 George 1 nor 1 Freddy 1 was 1 truly 1 refined. 1 Still, 1 they 1 did 1 not 1 hear 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 last 1 warning 1 or 1 they 1 would 1 have 1 avoided 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 Cecil, 1 and 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 were 1 walking 1 down 1 to 1 call 1 on 1 old 1 Mrs. 1 Butterworth. 1 Freddy 1 dropped 1 the 1 waistcoat 1 at 1 their 1 feet, 1 and 1 dashed 1 into 1 some 1 bracken. 1 George 1 whooped 1 in 1 their 1 faces, 1 turned 1 and 1 scudded 1 away 1 down 1 the 1 path 1 to 1 the 1 pond, 1 still 1 clad 1 in 1 Mr. 1 Beebe\u2019s 1 hat. 1 \u201cGracious 1 alive!\u201d 1 cried 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch. 1 \u201cWhoever 1 were 1 those 1 unfortunate 1 people? 1 Oh, 1 dears, 1 look 1 away! 1 And 1 poor 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 too! 1 Whatever 1 has 1 happened?\u201d 1 \u201cCome 1 this 1 way 1 immediately,\u201d 1 commanded 1 of 1 any 1 provision 1 of 1

1 of 1 Miss 1 Bartlett, 1 ventured 1 to 1 say: 1 \u201cI 1 wish 1 we 1 could. 1 Unluckily 1 I 1 have 1 letters. 1 If 1 you 1 do 1 want 1 to 1 go 1 out 1 alone, 1 won\u2019t 1 you 1 be 1 better 1 on 1

still 1 looked 1 disapproval, 1 and 1 she 1 so 1 far 1 conceded 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 as 1 to 1 say 1 that 1 she 1 would 1 only 1 go 1 for 1 a 1 little 1 walk, 1 and 1 keep 1 to 1 the 1 street 1

I 1 put 1 it 1 down 1 to 1 too 1 much 1 Beethoven.\u201d 1 Chapter 1 IV: 1 Fourth 1 Chapter 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 right. 1 Lucy 1 never 1 knew 1 her 1 desires 1 so 1 clearly 1 as 1 after 1 music. 1 She 1 had 1 not 1 really 1 appreciated 1 the 1 clergyman\u2019s 1 wit, 1 nor 1 the 1 suggestive 1 twitterings 1 of 1 Miss 1 Alan. 1 Conversation 1 was 1 tedious; 1 she 1 wanted 1 something 1 big, 1 and 1 she 1 believed 1 that 1 it 1 would 1 have 1 come 1 to 1 her 1 on 1 the 1 wind-swept 1 platform 1 of 1 an 1 electric 1 tram. 1 This 1 she 1 might 1 not 1 attempt. 1 It 1 was 1 unladylike. 1 Why? 1 Why 1 were 1 most 1 big 1 things 1 unladylike? 1 Charlotte 1 had 1 once 1 explained 1 to 1 her 1 why. 1 It 1 was 1 not 1 that 1 ladies 1 were 1 inferior 1 to 1 men; 1 it 1 was 1 that 1 they 1 were 1 different. 1 Their 1 mission 1 was 1 to 1 inspire 1 others 1 to 1 achievement 1 rather 1 than 1 to 1 achieve 1 themselves. 1 Indirectly, 1 by 1 means 1 of 1 tact 1 and 1 a 1 spotless 1 name, 1 a 1 lady 1 could 1 accomplish 1 much. 1 But 1 if 1 she 1 rushed 1 into 1 the 1 fray 1 herself 1 she 1 would 1 be 1 first 1 censured, 1 then 1 despised, 1 and 1 finally 1 ignored. 1 Poems 1 had 1 been 1 written 1 to 1 illustrate 1 this 1 point. 1 There 1 is 1 much 1 that 1 is 1 immortal 1 in 1 this 1 medieval 1 lady. 1 The 1 dragons 1 have 1 gone, 1 and 1 so 1 have 1 the 1 knights, 1 but 1 still 1 she 1 lingers 1 in 1 our 1 midst. 1 She 1 reigned 1 in 1 many 1 an 1 early 1 Victorian 1 castle, 1 and 1 was 1 Queen 1 of 1 much 1 early 1 Victorian 1 song. 1 It 1 is 1 sweet 1 to 1 protect 1 her 1 in 1 the 1 intervals 1 of 1 business, 1 sweet 1 to 1 pay 1 her 1 honour 1 when 1 she 1 has 1 cooked 1 our 1 dinner 1 well. 1 But 1 alas! 1 the 1 creature 1 grows 1 degenerate. 1 In 1 her 1 heart 1 also 1 there 1 are 1 springing 1 up 1 strange 1 desires. 1 She 1 too 1 is 1 enamoured 1 of 1 heavy 1 winds, 1 and 1 vast 1 panoramas, 1 and 1 green 1 expanses 1 of 1 the 1 sea. 1 She 1 has 1 marked 1 the 1 kingdom 1 of 1 this 1 world, 1 how 1 full 1 it 1 is 1 of 1 wealth, 1 and 1 beauty, 1 and 1 war--a 1 radiant 1 crust, 1 built 1 around 1 the 1 central 1 fires, 1 spinning 1 towards 1 the 1 receding 1 heavens. 1 Men, 1 declaring 1 that 1 she 1 inspires 1 them 1 to 1 it, 1 move 1 joyfully 1 over 1 the 1 surface, 1 having 1 the 1 most 1 delightful 1 meetings 1 with 1 other 1 men, 1 happy, 1 not 1 because 1 they 1 are 1 masculine, 1 but 1 because 1 they 1 are 1 alive. 1 Before 1 the 1 show 1 breaks 1 up 1 she 1 would 1 like 1 to 1 drop 1 the 1 august 1 title 1 of 1 the 1 Eternal 1 Woman, 1 and 1 go 1 there 1 as 1 her 1 transitory 1 self. 1 Lucy 1 does 1 not 1 stand 1 for 1 the 1 medieval 1 lady, 1 who 1 was 1 rather 1 an 1 ideal 1 to 1 which 1 she 1 was 1 bidden 1 to 1 lift 1 her 1 eyes 1 when 1 feeling 1 serious. 1 Nor 1 has 1 she 1 any 1 system 1 of 1 revolt. 1 Here 1 and 1 there 1 a 1 restriction 1 annoyed 1 her 1 particularly, 1 and 1 she 1 would 1 transgress 1 it, 1 and 1 perhaps 1 be 1 sorry 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 done 1 so. 1 This 1 afternoon 1 she 1 was 1 peculiarly 1 restive. 1 She 1 would 1 really 1 like 1 to 1 do 1 something 1 of 1 which 1 her 1 well-wishers 1 disapproved. 1 As 1 she 1 might 1 not 1 go 1 on 1 the 1 electric 1 tram, 1 she 1 went 1 to 1 Alinari\u2019s 1 shop. 1 There 1 she 1 bought 1 a 1 photograph 1 of 1 Botticelli\u2019s 1 \u201cBirth 1 of 1 Venus.\u201d 1 Venus, 1 being 1 a 1 pity, 1 spoilt 1 the 1 picture, 1 otherwise 1 so 1 charming, 1 and 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 had 1 persuaded 1 her 1 to 1 do 1 without 1 it. 1 (A 1 pity 1 in 1 art 1 of 1 course 1 signified 1 the 1 nude.) 1 Giorgione\u2019s 1 \u201cTempesta,\u201d 1 the 1 \u201cIdolino,\u201d 1 some 1 of 1 the 1 Sistine 1 frescoes 1 and 1 the 1 Apoxyomenos, 1 were 1 added 1 to 1 it. 1 She 1 felt 1 a 1 little 1 calmer 1 then, 1 and 1 bought 1 Fra 1 Angelico\u2019s 1 \u201cCoronation,\u201d 1 Giotto\u2019s 1 \u201cAscension 1 of 1 St. 1 John,\u201d 1 some 1 Della 1 Robbia 1 babies, 1 and 1 some 1 Guido 1 Reni 1 Madonnas. 1 For 1 her 1 taste 1 was 1 catholic, 1 and 1 she 1 extended 1 uncritical 1 approval 1 to 1 every 1 well-known 1 name. 1 But 1 though 1 she 1 spent 1 nearly 1 seven 1 lire, 1 the 1 gates 1 of 1 liberty 1 seemed 1 still 1 unopened. 1 She 1 was 1 conscious 1 of 1 her 1 discontent; 1 it 1 was 1 new 1 to 1 her 1 to 1 be 1 conscious 1 of 1 it. 1 \u201cThe 1 world,\u201d 1 she 1 thought, 1 \u201cis 1 certainly 1 full 1 of 1 beautiful 1 things, 1 if 1 only 1 I 1 could 1 come 1 across 1 them.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 not 1 surprising 1 that 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 disapproved 1 of 1 music, 1 declaring 1 that 1 it 1 always 1 left 1 her 1 daughter 1 peevish, 1 unpractical, 1 and 1 touchy. 1 \u201cNothing 1 ever 1 happens 1 to 1 me,\u201d 1 she 1 reflected, 1 as 1 she 1 entered 1 the 1 Piazza 1 Signoria 1 and 1 looked 1 nonchalantly 1 at 1 its 1 marvels, 1 now 1 fairly 1 familiar 1 to 1 her. 1 The 1 great 1 square 1 was 1 in 1 shadow; 1 the 1 sunshine 1 had 1 come 1 too 1 late 1 to 1 strike 1 it. 1 Neptune 1 was 1 already 1 unsubstantial 1 in 1 the 1 twilight, 1 half 1 god, 1 half 1 ghost, 1 and 1 his 1 fountain 1 plashed 1 dreamily 1 to 1 the 1 men 1 and 1 satyrs 1 who 1 idled 1 together 1 on 1 its 1 marge. 1 The 1 Loggia 1 showed 1 as 1 the 1 triple 1 entrance 1 of 1 a 1 cave, 1 wherein 1 many 1 a 1 deity, 1 shadowy, 1 but 1 immortal, 1 looking 1 forth 1 upon 1 the 1 arrivals 1 and 1 departures 1 of 1 mankind. 1 It 1 was 1 the 1 hour 1 of 1 unreality--the 1 hour, 1 that 1 is, 1 when 1 unfamiliar 1 things 1 are 1 real. 1 An 1 older 1 person 1 at 1 such 1 an 1 hour 1 and 1 in 1 such 1 a 1 place 1 might 1 think 1 that 1 sufficient 1 was 1 happening 1 to 1 him, 1 and 1 rest 1 content. 1 Lucy 1 desired 1 more. 1 She 1 fixed 1 her 1 eyes 1 wistfully 1 on 1 the 1 tower 1 of 1 the 1 palace, 1 which 1 rose 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 lower 1 darkness 1 like 1 a 1 pillar 1 of 1 roughened 1 gold. 1 It 1 seemed 1 no 1 longer 1 a 1 tower, 1 no 1 longer 1 supported 1 by 1 earth, 1 but 1 some 1 unattainable 1 treasure 1 throbbing 1 in 1 the 1 tranquil 1 sky. 1 Its 1 brightness 1 mesmerized 1 her, 1 still 1 dancing 1 before 1 her 1 eyes 1 when 1 she 1 bent 1 them 1 to 1 the 1 ground 1 and 1 started 1 towards 1 home. 1 Then 1 something 1 did 1 happen. 1 Two 1 Italians 1 by 1 the 1 Loggia 1 had 1 been 1 bickering 1 about 1 a 1 debt. 1 \u201cCinque 1 lire,\u201d 1 they 1 had 1 cried, 1 \u201ccinque 1 lire!\u201d 1 They 1 sparred 1 at 1 each 1 other, 1 and 1 one 1 of 1 them 1 was 1 hit 1 lightly 1 upon 1 the 1 chest. 1 He 1 frowned; 1 he 1 bent 1 towards 1 Lucy 1 with 1 a 1 look 1 of 1 interest, 1 as 1 if 1 he 1 had 1 an 1 important 1 message 1 for 1 her. 1 He 1 opened 1 his 1 lips 1 to 1 deliver 1 it, 1 and 1 a 1 stream 1 of 1 red 1 came 1 out 1 between 1 them 1 and 1 trickled 1 down 1 his 1 unshaven 1 chin. 1 That 1 was 1 all. 1 A 1 crowd 1 rose 1 out 1 of 1 the 1 dusk. 1 It 1 hid 1 this 1 extraordinary 1 man 1 from 1 her, 1 and 1 bore 1 him 1 away 1 to 1 the 1 fountain. 1 Mr. 1 George 1 Emerson 1 happened 1 to 1 be 1 a 1 few 1 paces 1 away, 1 looking 1 at 1 her 1 across 1 the 1 spot 1 where 1 the 1 man 1 had 1 been. 1 How 1 very 1 odd! 1 Across 1 something. 1 Even 1 as 1 she 1 caught 1 sight 1 of 1 him 1 he 1 grew 1 dim; 1 the 1 palace 1 itself 1 grew 1 dim, 1 swayed 1 above 1 her, 1 fell 1 on 1 to 1 her 1 softly, 1 slowly, 1 noiselessly, 1 and 1 the 1 sky 1 fell 1 with 1 it. 1 She 1 thought: 1 \u201cOh, 1 what 1 have 1 I 1 done?\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 what 1 have 1 I 1 done?\u201d 1 she 1 murmured, 1 and 1 opened 1 her 1 eyes. 1 George 1 Emerson 1 still 1 looked 1 at 1 her, 1 but 1 not 1 across 1 anything. 1 She 1 had 1 complained 1 of 1 dullness, 1 and 1 lo! 1 one 1 man 1 was 1 stabbed, 1 and 1 another 1 held 1 her 1 in 1 his 1 arms. 1 They 1 were 1 sitting 1 on 1 some 1 steps 1 in 1 the 1 Uffizi 1 Arcade. 1 He 1 must 1 have 1 carried 1 her. 1 He 1 rose 1 when 1 she 1 spoke, 1 and 1 began 1 to 1 dust 1 his 1 knees. 1 She 1 repeated: 1 \u201cOh, 1 what 1 have 1 I 1 done?\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 fainted.\u201d 1 \u201cI--I 1 am 1 very 1 sorry.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 are 1 you 1 now?\u201d 1 \u201cPerfectly 1 well--absolutely 1 well.\u201d 1 And 1 she 1 began 1 to 1 nod 1 and 1 smile. 1 \u201cThen 1 let 1 us 1 come 1 home. 1 There\u2019s 1 no 1 point 1 in 1 our 1 stopping.\u201d 1 He 1 held 1 out 1 his 1 hand 1 to 1 pull 1 her 1 up. 1 She 1 pretended 1 not 1 to 1 see 1 it. 1 The 1 cries 1 from 1 the 1 fountain--they 1 had 1 never 1 ceased--rang 1 emptily. 1 The 1 whole 1 world 1 seemed 1 pale 1 and 1 void 1 of 1 its 1 original 1 meaning. 1 \u201cHow 1 very 1 kind 1 you 1 have 1 been! 1 I 1 might 1 have 1 hurt 1 myself 1 falling. 1 But 1 now 1 I 1 am 1 well. 1 I 1 can 1 go 1 alone, 1 thank 1 you.\u201d 1 His 1 hand 1 was 1 still 1 extended. 1 \u201cOh, 1 my 1 photographs!\u201d 1 she 1 exclaimed 1 suddenly. 1 \u201cWhat 1 photographs?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 bought 1 some 1 photographs 1 at 1 Alinari\u2019s. 1 I 1 must 1 have 1 dropped 1 them 1 out 1 there 1 in 1 the 1 square.\u201d 1 She 1 looked 1 at 1 him 1 cautiously. 1 \u201cWould 1 you 1 add 1 to 1 your 1 kindness 1 by 1 fetching 1 them?\u201d 1 He 1 added 1 to 1 his 1 kindness. 1 As 1 soon 1 as 1 he 1 had 1 turned 1 his 1 back, 1 Lucy 1 arose 1 with 1 the 1 running 1 of 1 a 1 maniac 1 and 1 stole 1 down 1 the 1 arcade 1 towards 1 the 1 Arno. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Honeychurch!\u201d 1 She 1 stopped 1 with 1 her 1 hand 1 on 1 her 1 heart. 1 \u201cYou 1 sit 1 still; 1 you 1 aren\u2019t 1 fit 1 to 1 go 1 home 1 alone.\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 I 1 am, 1 thank 1 you 1 so 1 very 1 much.\u201d 1 \u201cNo, 1 you 1 aren\u2019t. 1 You\u2019d 1 go 1 openly 1 if 1 you 1 were.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 I 1 had 1 rather--\u201d 1 \u201cThen 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 fetch 1 your 1 photographs.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 had 1 rather 1 be 1 alone.\u201d 1 He 1 said 1 imperiously: 1 \u201cThe 1 man 1 is 1 dead--the 1 man 1 is 1 probably 1 dead; 1 sit 1 down 1 till 1 you 1 are 1 rested.\u201d 1 She 1 was 1 bewildered, 1 and 1 obeyed 1 him. 1 \u201cAnd 1 don\u2019t 1 move 1 till 1 I 1 come 1 back.\u201d 1 In 1 the 1 distance 1 she 1 saw 1 creatures 1 with 1 black 1 hoods, 1 such 1 as 1 appear 1 in 1 dreams. 1 The 1 palace 1 tower 1 had 1 lost 1 the 1 reflection 1 of 1 the 1 declining 1 day, 1 and 1 joined 1 itself 1 to 1 earth. 1 How 1 should 1 she 1 talk 1 to 1 Mr. 1 Emerson 1 when 1 he 1 returned 1 from 1 the 1 shadowy 1 square? 1 Again 1 the 1 thought 1 occurred 1 to 1 her, 1 \u201cOh, 1 what 1 have 1 I 1 done?\u201d--the 1 thought 1 that 1 she, 1 as 1 well 1 as 1 the 1 dying 1 man, 1 had 1 crossed 1 some 1 spiritual 1 boundary. 1 He 1 returned, 1 and 1 she 1 talked 1 of 1 the 1 murder. 1 Oddly 1 enough, 1 it 1 was 1 an 1 easy 1 topic. 1 She 1 spoke 1 of 1 the 1 Italian 1 character; 1 she 1 became 1 almost 1 garrulous 1 over 1 the 1 incident 1 that 1 had 1 made 1 her 1 faint 1 five 1 minutes 1 before. 1 Being 1 strong 1 physically, 1 she 1 soon 1 overcame 1 the 1 horror 1 of 1 blood. 1 She 1 rose 1 without 1 his 1 assistance, 1 and 1 though 1 wings 1 seemed 1 to 1 flutter 1 inside 1 her, 1 she 1 walked 1 firmly 1 enough 1 towards 1 the 1 Arno. 1 There 1 a 1 cabman 1 signalled 1 to 1 them; 1 they 1 refused 1 him. 1 \u201cAnd 1 the 1 murderer 1 tried 1 to 1 kiss 1 him, 1 you 1 say--how 1 very 1 odd 1 Italians 1 are!--and 1 gave 1 himself 1 up 1 to 1 the 1 police! 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 saying 1 that 1 Italians 1 know 1 everything, 1 but 1 I 1 think 1 they 1 are 1 rather 1 childish. 1 When 1 my 1 cousin 1 and 1 I 1 were 1 at 1 the 1 Pitti 1 yesterday--What 1 was 1 that?\u201d 1 He 1 had 1 thrown 1 something 1 into 1 the 1 stream. 1 \u201cWhat 1 did 1 you 1 throw 1 in?\u201d 1 \u201cThings 1 I 1 didn\u2019t 1 want,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 crossly. 1 \u201cMr. 1 Emerson!\u201d 1 \u201cWell?\u201d 1 \u201cWhere 1 are 1 the 1 photographs?\u201d 1 He 1 was 1 silent. 1 \u201cI 1 believe 1 it 1 was 1 my 1 photographs 1 that 1 you 1 threw 1 away.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 didn\u2019t 1 know 1 what 1 to 1 do 1 with 1 them,\u201d 1 he 1 cried, 1 and 1 his 1 voice 1 was 1 that 1 of 1 an 1 anxious 1 boy. 1 Her 1 heart 1 warmed 1 towards 1 him 1 for 1 the 1 first 1 time. 1 \u201cThey 1 were 1 covered 1 with 1 blood. 1 There! 1 I\u2019m 1 glad 1 I\u2019ve 1 told 1 you; 1 and 1 all 1 the 1 time 1 we 1 were 1 making 1 conversation 1 I 1 who 1 naturally 1 preferred 1 congratulations 1 to 1 apologies, 1 drew 1 down 1 his 1 mouth 1 at 1 the 1 corners. 1 Was 1 this 1 the 1 reception 1 his 1 action 1 would 1 get 1 from 1 the 1 world? 1 Of 1 course, 1 he 1 despised 1 the 1 world 1 as 1 a 1 whole; 1 every 1 thoughtful 1 man 1 should; 1 it 1 is 1 almost 1 a 1 test 1 of 1 refinement. 1 But 1 he 1 was 1 sensitive 1 to 1 the 1 successive 1 particles 1 of 1 it 1 which 1 he 1 encountered. 1 Occasionally 1 he 1 could 1 be 1 quite 1 crude. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 sorry 1 I 1 have 1 given 1 you 1 a 1 shock,\u201d 1 he 1 said 1 dryly. 1 \u201cI 1 fear 1 that 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 choice 1 does 1 not 1 meet 1 with 1 your 1 approval.\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 that. 1 But 1 you 1 ought 1 to 1 have 1 stopped 1 me. 1 I 1 know 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 only 1 a 1 little 1 as 1 time 1 goes. 1 Perhaps 1 I 1 oughtn\u2019t 1 to 1 have 1 discussed 1 her 1 so 1 freely 1 with 1 any 1 one; 1 certainly 1 not 1 with 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 are 1 conscious 1 of 1 having 1 said 1 something 1 indiscreet?\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 pulled 1 himself 1 together. 1 Really, 1 Mr. 1 Vyse 1 had 1 the 1 art 1 of 1 placing 1 one 1 in 1 the 1 most 1 tiresome 1 positions. 1 He 1 was 1 driven 1 to 1 use 1 the 1 prerogatives 1 of 1 his 1 profession. 1 \u201cNo, 1 I 1 have 1 said 1 nothing 1 indiscreet. 1 I 1 foresaw 1 at 1 Florence 1 that 1 her 1 quiet, 1 uneventful 1 childhood 1 must 1 end, 1 and 1 it 1 has 1 ended. 1 I 1 realized 1 dimly 1 enough 1 that 1 she 1 might 1 take 1 some 1 momentous 1 step. 1 She 1 has 1 taken 1 it. 1 She 1 has 1 learnt--you 1 will 1 let 1 me 1 talk 1 freely, 1 as 1 I 1 have 1 begun 1 freely--she 1 has 1 learnt 1 what 1 it 1 is 1 to 1 love: 1 the 1 greatest 1 lesson, 1 some 1 people 1 will 1 tell 1 you, 1 that 1 our 1 earthly 1 life 1 provides.\u201d 1 It 1 was 1 now 1 time 1 for 1 him 1 to 1 wave 1 his 1 hat 1 at 1 the 1 approaching 1 trio. 1 He 1 did 1 not 1 omit 1 to 1 do 1 so. 1 \u201cShe 1 has 1 learnt 1 through 1 you,\u201d 1 and 1 if 1 his 1 voice 1 was 1 still 1 clerical, 1 it 1 was 1 now 1 also 1 sincere; 1 \u201clet 1 it 1 be 1 your 1 care 1 that 1 her 1 knowledge 1 is 1 profitable 1 to 1 her.\u201d 1 \u201cGrazie 1 tante!\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 did 1 not 1 like 1 parsons. 1 \u201cHave 1 you 1 heard?\u201d 1 shouted 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 as 1 she 1 toiled 1 up 1 the 1 sloping 1 garden. 1 \u201cOh, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 have 1 you 1 heard 1 the 1 news?\u201d 1 Freddy, 1 now 1 full 1 of 1 geniality, 1 whistled 1 the 1 wedding 1 march. 1 Youth 1 seldom 1 criticizes 1 the 1 accomplished 1 fact. 1 \u201cIndeed 1 I 1 have!\u201d 1 he 1 cried. 1 He 1 looked 1 at 1 Lucy. 1 In 1 her 1 presence 1 he 1 could 1 not 1 act 1 the 1 parson 1 any 1 longer--at 1 all 1 events 1 not 1 without 1 apology. 1 \u201cMrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 I\u2019m 1 going 1 to 1 do 1 what 1 I 1 am 1 always 1 supposed 1 to 1 do, 1 but 1 generally 1 I\u2019m 1 too 1 shy. 1 I 1 want 1 to 1 invoke 1 every 1 kind 1 of 1 blessing 1 on 1 them, 1 grave 1 and 1 gay, 1 great 1 and 1 small. 1 I 1 want 1 them 1 all 1 their 1 lives 1 to 1 be 1 supremely 1 good 1 and 1 supremely 1 happy 1 as 1 husband 1 and 1 wife, 1 as 1 father 1 and 1 mother. 1 And 1 now 1 I 1 want 1 my 1 tea.\u201d 1 \u201cYou 1 only 1 asked 1 for 1 it 1 just 1 in 1 time,\u201d 1 the 1 lady 1 retorted. 1 \u201cHow 1 dare 1 you 1 be 1 serious 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner?\u201d 1 He 1 took 1 his 1 tone 1 from 1 her. 1 There 1 was 1 no 1 more 1 heavy 1 beneficence, 1 no 1 more 1 attempts 1 to 1 dignify 1 the 1 situation 1 with 1 poetry 1 or 1 the 1 Scriptures. 1 None 1 of 1 them 1 dared 1 or 1 was 1 able 1 to 1 be 1 serious 1 any 1 more. 1 An 1 engagement 1 is 1 so 1 potent 1 a 1 thing 1 that 1 sooner 1 or 1 later 1 it 1 reduces 1 all 1 who 1 speak 1 of 1 it 1 to 1 this 1 state 1 of 1 cheerful 1 awe. 1 Away 1 from 1 it, 1 in 1 the 1 solitude 1 of 1 their 1 rooms, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 and 1 even 1 Freddy, 1 might 1 again 1 be 1 critical. 1 But 1 in 1 its 1 presence 1 and 1 in 1 the 1 presence 1 of 1 each 1 other 1 they 1 were 1 sincerely 1 hilarious. 1 It 1 has 1 a 1 strange 1 power, 1 for 1 it 1 compels 1 not 1 only 1 the 1 lips, 1 but 1 the 1 very 1 heart. 1 The 1 chief 1 parallel 1 to 1 compare 1 one 1 great 1 thing 1 with 1 another--is 1 the 1 power 1 over 1 us 1 of 1 a 1 temple 1 of 1 some 1 alien 1 creed. 1 Standing 1 outside, 1 we 1 deride 1 or 1 oppose 1 it, 1 or 1 at 1 the 1 most 1 feel 1 sentimental. 1 Inside, 1 though 1 the 1 saints 1 and 1 gods 1 are 1 not 1 ours, 1 we 1 become 1 true 1 believers, 1 in 1 case 1 any 1 true 1 believer 1 should 1 be 1 present. 1 So 1 it 1 was 1 that 1 after 1 the 1 gropings 1 and 1 the 1 misgivings 1 of 1 the 1 afternoon 1 they 1 pulled 1 themselves 1 together 1 and 1 settled 1 down 1 to 1 a 1 very 1 pleasant 1 tea-party. 1 If 1 they 1 were 1 hypocrites 1 they 1 did 1 not 1 know 1 it, 1 and 1 their 1 hypocrisy 1 had 1 every 1 chance 1 of 1 setting 1 and 1 of 1 becoming 1 true. 1 Anne, 1 putting 1 down 1 each 1 plate 1 as 1 if 1 it 1 were 1 a 1 wedding 1 present, 1 stimulated 1 them 1 greatly. 1 They 1 could 1 not 1 lag 1 behind 1 that 1 smile 1 of 1 hers 1 which 1 she 1 gave 1 them 1 ere 1 she 1 kicked 1 the 1 drawing-room 1 door. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 chirruped. 1 Freddy 1 was 1 at 1 his 1 wittiest, 1 referring 1 to 1 Cecil 1 as 1 the 1 \u201cFiasco\u201d--family 1 honoured 1 pun 1 on 1 fiance. 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 amusing 1 and 1 portly, 1 promised 1 well 1 as 1 a 1 mother-in-law. 1 As 1 for 1 Lucy 1 and 1 Cecil, 1 for 1 whom 1 the 1 temple 1 had 1 been 1 built, 1 they 1 also 1 joined 1 in 1 the 1 merry 1 ritual, 1 but 1 waited, 1 as 1 earnest 1 worshippers 1 should, 1 for 1 the 1 disclosure 1 of 1 some 1 holier 1 shrine 1 of 1 joy. 1 Chapter 1 IX: 1 Lucy 1 As 1 a 1 Work 1 of 1 Art 1 A 1 few 1 days 1 after 1 the 1 engagement 1 was 1 announced 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 made 1 Lucy 1 and 1 her 1 Fiasco 1 come 1 to 1 a 1 little 1 garden-party 1 in 1 the 1 neighbourhood, 1 for 1 naturally 1 she 1 wanted 1 to 1 show 1 people 1 that 1 her 1 daughter 1 was 1 marrying 1 a 1 presentable 1 man. 1 Cecil 1 was 1 more 1 than 1 presentable; 1 he 1 looked 1 distinguished, 1 and 1 it 1 was 1 very 1 pleasant 1 to 1 see 1 his 1 slim 1 figure 1 keeping 1 step 1 with 1 Lucy, 1 and 1 his 1 long, 1 fair 1 face 1 responding 1 when 1 Lucy 1 spoke 1 to 1 him. 1 People 1 congratulated 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 which 1 is, 1 I 1 believe, 1 a 1 social 1 blunder, 1 but 1 it 1 pleased 1 her, 1 and 1 she 1 introduced 1 Cecil 1 rather 1 indiscriminately 1 to 1 some 1 stuffy 1 dowagers. 1 At 1 tea 1 a 1 misfortune 1 took 1 place: 1 a 1 cup 1 of 1 coffee 1 was 1 upset 1 over 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 figured 1 silk, 1 and 1 though 1 Lucy 1 feigned 1 indifference, 1 her 1 mother 1 feigned 1 nothing 1 of 1 the 1 sort 1 but 1 dragged 1 her 1 indoors 1 to 1 have 1 the 1 frock 1 treated 1 by 1 a 1 sympathetic 1 maid. 1 They 1 were 1 gone 1 some 1 time, 1 and 1 Cecil 1 was 1 left 1 with 1 the 1 dowagers. 1 When 1 they 1 returned 1 he 1 was 1 not 1 as 1 pleasant 1 as 1 he 1 had 1 been. 1 \u201cDo 1 you 1 go 1 to 1 much 1 of 1 this 1 sort 1 of 1 thing?\u201d 1 he 1 asked 1 when 1 they 1 were 1 driving 1 home. 1 \u201cOh, 1 now 1 and 1 then,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 who 1 had 1 rather 1 enjoyed 1 herself. 1 \u201cIs 1 it 1 typical 1 of 1 country 1 society?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 suppose 1 so. 1 Mother, 1 would 1 it 1 be?\u201d 1 \u201cPlenty 1 of 1 society,\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 who 1 was 1 trying 1 to 1 remember 1 the 1 hang 1 of 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 dresses. 1 Seeing 1 that 1 her 1 thoughts 1 were 1 elsewhere, 1 Cecil 1 bent 1 towards 1 Lucy 1 and 1 said: 1 \u201cTo 1 me 1 it 1 seemed 1 perfectly 1 appalling, 1 disastrous, 1 portentous.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 so 1 sorry 1 that 1 you 1 were 1 stranded.\u201d 1 \u201cNot 1 that, 1 but 1 the 1 congratulations. 1 It 1 is 1 so 1 disgusting, 1 the 1 way 1 an 1 engagement 1 is 1 regarded 1 as 1 public 1 property--a 1 kind 1 of 1 waste 1 place 1 where 1 every 1 outsider 1 may 1 shoot 1 his 1 vulgar 1 sentiment. 1 All 1 those 1 old 1 women 1 smirking!\u201d 1 \u201cOne 1 has 1 to 1 go 1 through 1 it, 1 I 1 suppose. 1 They 1 won\u2019t 1 notice 1 us 1 so 1 much 1 next 1 time.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 my 1 point 1 is 1 that 1 their 1 whole 1 attitude 1 is 1 wrong. 1 An 1 engagement--horrid 1 word 1 in 1 the 1 first 1 place--is 1 a 1 private 1 matter, 1 and 1 should 1 be 1 treated 1 as 1 such.\u201d 1 Yet 1 the 1 smirking 1 old 1 women, 1 however 1 wrong 1 individually, 1 were 1 racially 1 correct. 1 The 1 spirit 1 of 1 the 1 generations 1 had 1 smiled 1 through 1 them, 1 rejoicing 1 in 1 the 1 engagement 1 of 1 Cecil 1 and 1 Lucy 1 because 1 it 1 promised 1 the 1 continuance 1 of 1 life 1 on 1 earth. 1 To 1 Cecil 1 and 1 Lucy 1 it 1 promised 1 something 1 quite 1 different--personal 1 love. 1 Hence 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 irritation 1 and 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 belief 1 that 1 his 1 irritation 1 was 1 just. 1 \u201cHow 1 tiresome!\u201d 1 she 1 said. 1 \u201cCouldn\u2019t 1 you 1 have 1 escaped 1 to 1 tennis?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 play 1 tennis--at 1 least, 1 not 1 in 1 public. 1 The 1 neighbourhood 1 is 1 deprived 1 of 1 the 1 romance 1 of 1 me 1 being 1 athletic. 1 Such 1 romance 1 as 1 I 1 have 1 is 1 that 1 of 1 the 1 Inglese 1 Italianato.\u201d 1 \u201cInglese 1 Italianato?\u201d 1 \u201cE 1 un 1 diavolo 1 incarnato! 1 You 1 know 1 the 1 proverb?\u201d 1 She 1 did 1 not. 1 Nor 1 did 1 it 1 seem 1 applicable 1 to 1 a 1 young 1 man 1 who 1 had 1 spent 1 a 1 quiet 1 winter 1 in 1 Rome 1 with 1 his 1 mother. 1 But 1 Cecil, 1 since 1 his 1 engagement, 1 had 1 taken 1 to 1 affect 1 a 1 cosmopolitan 1 naughtiness 1 which 1 he 1 was 1 far 1 from 1 possessing. 1 \u201cWell,\u201d 1 said 1 he, 1 \u201cI 1 cannot 1 help 1 it 1 if 1 they 1 do 1 disapprove 1 of 1 me. 1 There 1 are 1 certain 1 irremovable 1 barriers 1 between 1 myself 1 and 1 them, 1 and 1 I 1 must 1 accept 1 them.\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 all 1 have 1 our 1 limitations, 1 I 1 suppose,\u201d 1 said 1 wise 1 Lucy. 1 \u201cSometimes 1 they 1 are 1 forced 1 on 1 us, 1 though,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 saw 1 from 1 her 1 remark 1 that 1 she 1 did 1 not 1 quite 1 understand 1 his 1 position. 1 \u201cHow?\u201d 1 \u201cIt 1 makes 1 a 1 difference 1 doesn\u2019t 1 it, 1 whether 1 we 1 fully 1 fence 1 ourselves 1 in, 1 or 1 whether 1 we 1 are 1 fenced 1 out 1 by 1 the 1 barriers 1 of 1 others?\u201d 1 She 1 thought 1 a 1 moment, 1 and 1 agreed 1 that 1 it 1 did 1 make 1 a 1 difference. 1 \u201cDifference?\u201d 1 cried 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch, 1 suddenly 1 alert. 1 \u201cI 1 don\u2019t 1 see 1 any 1 difference. 1 Fences 1 are 1 fences, 1 especially 1 when 1 they 1 are 1 in 1 the 1 same 1 place.\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 were 1 speaking 1 of 1 motives,\u201d 1 said 1 Cecil, 1 on 1 whom 1 the 1 interruption 1 jarred. 1 \u201cMy 1 dear 1 Cecil, 1 look 1 here.\u201d 1 She 1 spread 1 out 1 her 1 knees 1 and 1 perched 1 her 1 card-case 1 on 1 her 1 lap. 1 \u201cThis 1 is 1 me. 1 That\u2019s 1 Windy 1 Corner. 1 The 1 rest 1 of 1 the 1 pattern 1 is 1 the 1 other 1 people. 1 Motives 1 are 1 all 1 very 1 well, 1 but 1 the 1 fence 1 comes 1 here.\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 weren\u2019t 1 talking 1 of 1 real 1 fences,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy, 1 laughing. 1 \u201cOh, 1 I 1 see, 1 dear--poetry.\u201d 1 She 1 leant 1 placidly 1 back. 1 Cecil 1 wondered 1 why 1 Lucy 1 had 1 been 1 amused. 1 \u201cI 1 tell 1 you 1 who 1 has 1 no 1 \u2018fences,\u2019 1 as 1 you 1 call 1 them,\u201d 1 she 1 said, 1 \u201cand 1 that\u2019s 1 Mr. 1 Beebe.\u201d 1 \u201cA 1 parson 1 fenceless 1 would 1 mean 1 a 1 parson 1 defenceless.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 was 1 slow 1 to 1 follow 1 what 1 people 1 said, 1 but 1 quick 1 enough 1 to 1 detect 1 what 1 they 1 meant. 1 She 1 missed 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 epigram, 1 but 1 grasped 1 the 1 feeling 1 that 1 prompted 1 it. 1 \u201cDon\u2019t 1 you 1 like 1 Mr. 1 Beebe?\u201d 1 she 1 asked 1 thoughtfully. 1 \u201cI 1 never 1 said 1 so!\u201d 1 he 1 cried. 1 \u201cI 1 consider 1 him 1 far 1 above 1 the 1 average. 1 I 1 only 1 denied--\u201d 1 And 1 he 1 swept 1 off 1 on 1 the 1 subject 1 of 1 fences 1 again, 1 and 1 was 1 brilliant. 1 \u201cNow, 1 a 1 clergyman 1 that 1 I 1 do 1 hate,\u201d 1 said 1 she 1 wanting 1 to 1 say 1 something 1 sympathetic, 1 \u201ca 1 clergyman 1 that 1 does 1 have 1 fences, 1 and 1 the 1 most 1 dreadful 1 ones, 1 is 1 Mr. 1 Eager, 1 the 1 English 1 chaplain 1 at 1 Florence. 1 He 1 was 1 truly 1 insincere--not 1 merely 1 the 1 manner 1 unfortunate. 1 He 1 was 1 a 1 snob, 1 and 1 so 1 conceited, 1 and 1 he 1 did 1 say 1 such 1 unkind 1 things.\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 sort 1 of 1 things?\u201d 1 \u201cThere 1 was 1 an 1 old 1 man 1 at 1 the 1 Bertolini 1 whom 1 he 1 said 1 had 1 murdered 1 his 1 wife.\u201d 1 \u201cPerhaps 1 he 1 had.\u201d 1 \u201cNo!\u201d 1 \u201cWhy 1 \u2018no\u2019?\u201d 1 \u201cHe 1 was 1 such 1 a 1 nice 1 old 1 man, 1 I\u2019m 1 sure.\u201d 1 Cecil 1 laughed 1 at 1 her 1 feminine 1 inconsequence. 1 \u201cWell, 1 I 1 did 1 try 1 to 1 sift 1 the 1 thing. 1 Mr. 1 Eager 1 would 1 never 1 come 1 to 1 the 1 point. 1 He 1 prefers 1 it 1 vague--said 1 the 1 old 1 man 1 had 1 \u2018practically\u2019 1 murdered 1 his 1 wife--had 1 murdered 1 her 1 in 1 the 1 sight 1 of 1 God.\u201d 1 \u201cHush, 1 dear!\u201d 1 said 1 Mrs. 1 Honeychurch 1 absently. 1 \u201cBut 1 isn\u2019t 1 it 1 intolerable 1 that 1 a 1 person 1 whom 1 we\u2019re 1 told 1 to 1 imitate 1 should 1 go 1 round 1 spreading 1 slander? 1 It 1 was, 1 I 1 believe, 1 chiefly 1 owing 1 to 1 him 1 that 1 the 1 old 1 man 1 was 1 dropped. 1 People 1 pretended 1 he 1 was 1 vulgar, 1 but 1 he 1 certainly 1 wasn\u2019t 1 that.\u201d 1 \u201cPoor 1 old 1 man! 1 What 1 was 1 his 1 name?\u201d 1 \u201cHarris,\u201d 1 said 1 Lucy 1 glibly. 1 \u201cLet\u2019s 1 like 1 the 1 old 1 father, 1 and 1 look 1 forward 1 to 1 seeing 1 him 1 again. 1 As 1 for 1 the 1 son, 1 I 1 am 1 sorry 1 for 1 him 1 when 1 we 1 meet, 1 rather 1 than 1 for 1 myself. 1 They 1 are 1 known 1 to 1 Cecil, 1 who 1 is 1 very 1 well 1 and 1 spoke 1 of 1 you 1 the 1 other 1 day. 1 We 1 expect 1 to 1 be 1 married 1 in 1 January. 1 \u201cMiss 1 Lavish 1 cannot 1 have 1 told 1 you 1 much 1 about 1 me, 1 for 1 I 1 am 1 not 1 at 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 at 1 all, 1 but 1 here. 1 Please 1 do 1 not 1 put 1 \u2018Private\u2019 1 outside 1 your 1 envelope 1 again. 1 No 1 one 1 opens 1 my 1 letters. 1 \u201cYours 1 affectionately, 1 \u201cL. 1 M. 1 Honeychurch.\u201d 1 Secrecy 1 has 1 this 1 disadvantage: 1 we 1 lose 1 the 1 sense 1 of 1 proportion; 1 we 1 cannot 1 tell 1 whether 1 our 1 secret 1 is 1 important 1 or 1 not. 1 Were 1 Lucy 1 and 1 her 1 cousin 1 closeted 1 with 1 a 1 great 1 thing 1 which 1 would 1 destroy 1 Cecil\u2019s 1 life 1 if 1 he 1 discovered 1 it, 1 or 1 with 1 a 1 little 1 thing 1 which 1 he 1 would 1 laugh 1 at? 1 Miss 1 Bartlett 1 suggested 1 the 1 former. 1 Perhaps 1 she 1 was 1 right. 1 It 1 had 1 become 1 a 1 great 1 thing 1 now. 1 Left 1 to 1 herself, 1 Lucy 1 would 1 have 1 told 1 her 1 mother 1 and 1 her 1 lover 1 ingenuously, 1 and 1 it 1 would 1 have 1 remained 1 a 1 little 1 thing. 1 \u201cEmerson, 1 not 1 Harris\u201d; 1 it 1 was 1 only 1 that 1 a 1 few 1 weeks 1 ago. 1 She 1 tried 1 to 1 tell 1 Cecil 1 even 1 now 1 when 1 they 1 were 1 laughing 1 about 1 some 1 beautiful 1 lady 1 who 1 had 1 smitten 1 his 1 heart 1 at 1 school. 1 But 1 her 1 body 1 behaved 1 so 1 ridiculously 1 that 1 she 1 stopped. 1 She 1 and 1 her 1 secret 1 stayed 1 ten 1 days 1 longer 1 in 1 the 1 deserted 1 Metropolis 1 visiting 1 the 1 scenes 1 they 1 were 1 to 1 know 1 so 1 well 1 later 1 on. 1 It 1 did 1 her 1 no 1 harm, 1 Cecil 1 thought, 1 to 1 learn 1 the 1 framework 1 of 1 society, 1 while 1 society 1 itself 1 was 1 absent 1 on 1 the 1 golf-links 1 or 1 the 1 moors. 1 The 1 weather 1 was 1 cool, 1 and 1 it 1 did 1 her 1 no 1 harm. 1 In 1 spite 1 of 1 the 1 season, 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 managed 1 to 1 scrape 1 together 1 a 1 dinner-party 1 consisting 1 entirely 1 of 1 the 1 grandchildren 1 of 1 famous 1 people. 1 The 1 food 1 was 1 poor, 1 but 1 the 1 talk 1 had 1 a 1 witty 1 weariness 1 that 1 impressed 1 the 1 girl. 1 One 1 was 1 tired 1 of 1 everything, 1 it 1 seemed. 1 One 1 launched 1 into 1 enthusiasms 1 only 1 to 1 collapse 1 gracefully, 1 and 1 pick 1 oneself 1 up 1 amid 1 sympathetic 1 laughter. 1 In 1 this 1 atmosphere 1 the 1 Pension 1 Bertolini 1 and 1 Windy 1 Corner 1 appeared 1 equally 1 crude, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 saw 1 that 1 her 1 London 1 career 1 would 1 estrange 1 her 1 a 1 little 1 from 1 all 1 that 1 she 1 had 1 loved 1 in 1 the 1 past. 1 The 1 grandchildren 1 asked 1 her 1 to 1 play 1 the 1 piano. 1 She 1 played 1 Schumann. 1 \u201cNow 1 some 1 Beethoven\u201d 1 called 1 Cecil, 1 when 1 the 1 querulous 1 beauty 1 of 1 the 1 music 1 had 1 died. 1 She 1 shook 1 her 1 head 1 and 1 played 1 Schumann 1 again. 1 The 1 melody 1 rose, 1 unprofitably 1 magical. 1 It 1 broke; 1 it 1 was 1 resumed 1 broken, 1 not 1 marching 1 once 1 from 1 the 1 cradle 1 to 1 the 1 grave. 1 The 1 sadness 1 of 1 the 1 incomplete--the 1 sadness 1 that 1 is 1 often 1 Life, 1 but 1 should 1 never 1 be 1 Art--throbbed 1 in 1 its 1 disjected 1 phrases, 1 and 1 made 1 the 1 nerves 1 of 1 the 1 audience 1 throb. 1 Not 1 thus 1 had 1 she 1 played 1 on 1 the 1 little 1 draped 1 piano 1 at 1 the 1 Bertolini, 1 and 1 \u201cToo 1 much 1 Schumann\u201d 1 was 1 not 1 the 1 remark 1 that 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 had 1 passed 1 to 1 himself 1 when 1 she 1 returned. 1 When 1 the 1 guests 1 were 1 gone, 1 and 1 Lucy 1 had 1 gone 1 to 1 bed, 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 paced 1 up 1 and 1 down 1 the 1 drawing-room, 1 discussing 1 her 1 little 1 party 1 with 1 her 1 son. 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 was 1 a 1 nice 1 woman, 1 but 1 her 1 personality, 1 like 1 many 1 another\u2019s, 1 had 1 been 1 swamped 1 by 1 London, 1 for 1 it 1 needs 1 a 1 strong 1 head 1 to 1 live 1 among 1 many 1 people. 1 The 1 too 1 vast 1 orb 1 of 1 her 1 fate 1 had 1 crushed 1 her; 1 and 1 she 1 had 1 seen 1 too 1 many 1 seasons, 1 too 1 many 1 cities, 1 too 1 many 1 men, 1 for 1 her 1 abilities, 1 and 1 even 1 with 1 Cecil 1 she 1 was 1 mechanical, 1 and 1 behaved 1 as 1 if 1 he 1 was 1 not 1 one 1 son, 1 but, 1 so 1 to 1 speak, 1 a 1 filial 1 crowd. 1 \u201cMake 1 Lucy 1 one 1 of 1 us,\u201d 1 she 1 said, 1 looking 1 round 1 intelligently 1 at 1 the 1 end 1 of 1 each 1 sentence, 1 and 1 straining 1 her 1 lips 1 apart 1 until 1 she 1 spoke 1 again. 1 \u201cLucy 1 is 1 becoming 1 wonderful--wonderful.\u201d 1 \u201cHer 1 music 1 always 1 was 1 wonderful.\u201d 1 \u201cYes, 1 but 1 she 1 is 1 purging 1 off 1 the 1 Honeychurch 1 taint, 1 most 1 excellent 1 Honeychurches, 1 but 1 you 1 know 1 what 1 I 1 mean. 1 She 1 is 1 not 1 always 1 quoting 1 servants, 1 or 1 asking 1 one 1 how 1 the 1 pudding 1 is 1 made.\u201d 1 \u201cItaly 1 has 1 done 1 it.\u201d 1 \u201cPerhaps,\u201d 1 she 1 murmured, 1 thinking 1 of 1 the 1 museum 1 that 1 represented 1 Italy 1 to 1 her. 1 \u201cIt 1 is 1 just 1 possible. 1 Cecil, 1 mind 1 you 1 marry 1 her 1 next 1 January. 1 She 1 is 1 one 1 of 1 us 1 already.\u201d 1 \u201cBut 1 her 1 music!\u201d 1 he 1 exclaimed. 1 \u201cThe 1 style 1 of 1 her! 1 How 1 she 1 kept 1 to 1 Schumann 1 when, 1 like 1 an 1 idiot, 1 I 1 wanted 1 Beethoven. 1 Schumann 1 was 1 right 1 for 1 this 1 evening. 1 Schumann 1 was 1 the 1 thing. 1 Do 1 you 1 know, 1 mother, 1 I 1 shall 1 have 1 our 1 children 1 educated 1 just 1 like 1 Lucy. 1 Bring 1 them 1 up 1 among 1 honest 1 country 1 folks 1 for 1 freshness, 1 send 1 them 1 to 1 Italy 1 for 1 subtlety, 1 and 1 then--not 1 till 1 then--let 1 them 1 come 1 to 1 London. 1 I 1 don\u2019t 1 believe 1 in 1 these 1 London 1 educations--\u201d 1 He 1 broke 1 off, 1 remembering 1 that 1 he 1 had 1 had 1 one 1 himself, 1 and 1 concluded, 1 \u201cAt 1 all 1 events, 1 not 1 for 1 women.\u201d 1 \u201cMake 1 her 1 one 1 of 1 us,\u201d 1 repeated 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse, 1 and 1 processed 1 to 1 bed. 1 As 1 she 1 was 1 dozing 1 off, 1 a 1 cry--the 1 cry 1 of 1 nightmare--rang 1 from 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 room. 1 Lucy 1 could 1 ring 1 for 1 the 1 maid 1 if 1 she 1 liked 1 but 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 thought 1 it 1 kind 1 to 1 go 1 herself. 1 She 1 found 1 the 1 girl 1 sitting 1 upright 1 with 1 her 1 hand 1 on 1 her 1 cheek. 1 \u201cI 1 am 1 so 1 sorry, 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse--it 1 is 1 these 1 dreams.\u201d 1 \u201cBad 1 dreams?\u201d 1 \u201cJust 1 dreams.\u201d 1 The 1 elder 1 lady 1 smiled 1 and 1 kissed 1 her, 1 saying 1 very 1 distinctly: 1 \u201cYou 1 should 1 have 1 heard 1 us 1 talking 1 about 1 you, 1 dear. 1 He 1 admires 1 you 1 more 1 than 1 ever. 1 Dream 1 of 1 that.\u201d 1 Lucy 1 returned 1 the 1 kiss, 1 still 1 covering 1 one 1 cheek 1 with 1 her 1 hand. 1 Mrs. 1 Vyse 1 recessed 1 to 1 bed. 1 Cecil, 1 whom 1 the 1 cry 1 had 1 not 1 awoke, 1 snored. 1 Darkness 1 enveloped 1 the 1 flat. 1 Chapter 1 XII: 1 Twelfth 1 Chapter 1 It 1 was 1 a 1 Saturday 1 afternoon, 1 gay 1 and 1 brilliant 1 after 1 abundant 1 rains, 1 and 1 the 1 spirit 1 of 1 youth 1 dwelt 1 in 1 it, 1 though 1 the 1 season 1 was 1 now 1 autumn. 1 All 1 that 1 was 1 gracious 1 triumphed. 1 As 1 the 1 motorcars 1 passed 1 through 1 Summer 1 Street 1 they 1 raised 1 only 1 a 1 little 1 dust, 1 and 1 their 1 stench 1 was 1 soon 1 dispersed 1 by 1 the 1 wind 1 and 1 replaced 1 by 1 the 1 scent 1 of 1 the 1 wet 1 birches 1 or 1 of 1 the 1 pines. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe, 1 at 1 leisure 1 for 1 life\u2019s 1 amenities, 1 leant 1 over 1 his 1 Rectory 1 gate. 1 Freddy 1 leant 1 by 1 him, 1 smoking 1 a 1 pendant 1 pipe. 1 \u201cSuppose 1 we 1 go 1 and 1 hinder 1 those 1 new 1 people 1 opposite 1 for 1 a 1 little.\u201d 1 \u201cM\u2019m.\u201d 1 \u201cThey 1 might 1 amuse 1 you.\u201d 1 Freddy, 1 whom 1 his 1 fellow-creatures 1 never 1 amused, 1 suggested 1 that 1 the 1 new 1 people 1 might 1 be 1 feeling 1 a 1 bit 1 busy, 1 and 1 so 1 on, 1 since 1 they 1 had 1 only 1 just 1 moved 1 in. 1 \u201cI 1 suggested 1 we 1 should 1 hinder 1 them,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 \u201cThey 1 are 1 worth 1 it.\u201d 1 Unlatching 1 the 1 gate, 1 he 1 sauntered 1 over 1 the 1 triangular 1 green 1 to 1 Cissie 1 Villa. 1 \u201cHullo!\u201d 1 he 1 cried, 1 shouting 1 in 1 at 1 the 1 open 1 door, 1 through 1 which 1 much 1 squalor 1 was 1 visible. 1 A 1 grave 1 voice 1 replied, 1 \u201cHullo!\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019ve 1 brought 1 someone 1 to 1 see 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cI\u2019ll 1 be 1 down 1 in 1 a 1 minute.\u201d 1 The 1 passage 1 was 1 blocked 1 by 1 a 1 wardrobe, 1 which 1 the 1 removal 1 men 1 had 1 failed 1 to 1 carry 1 up 1 the 1 stairs. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 edged 1 round 1 it 1 with 1 difficulty. 1 The 1 sitting-room 1 itself 1 was 1 blocked 1 with 1 books. 1 \u201cAre 1 these 1 people 1 great 1 readers?\u201d 1 Freddy 1 whispered. 1 \u201cAre 1 they 1 that 1 sort?\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 fancy 1 they 1 know 1 how 1 to 1 read--a 1 rare 1 accomplishment. 1 What 1 have 1 they 1 got? 1 Byron. 1 Exactly. 1 A 1 Shropshire 1 Lad. 1 Never 1 heard 1 of 1 it. 1 The 1 Way 1 of 1 All 1 Flesh. 1 Never 1 heard 1 of 1 it. 1 Gibbon. 1 Hullo! 1 dear 1 George 1 reads 1 German. 1 Um--um--Schopenhauer, 1 Nietzsche, 1 and 1 so 1 we 1 go 1 on. 1 Well, 1 I 1 suppose 1 your 1 generation 1 knows 1 its 1 own 1 business, 1 Honeychurch.\u201d 1 \u201cMr. 1 Beebe, 1 look 1 at 1 that,\u201d 1 said 1 Freddy 1 in 1 awestruck 1 tones. 1 On 1 the 1 cornice 1 of 1 the 1 wardrobe, 1 the 1 hand 1 of 1 an 1 amateur 1 had 1 painted 1 this 1 inscription: 1 \u201cMistrust 1 all 1 enterprises 1 that 1 require 1 new 1 clothes.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 know. 1 Isn\u2019t 1 it 1 jolly? 1 I 1 like 1 that. 1 I\u2019m 1 certain 1 that\u2019s 1 the 1 old 1 man\u2019s 1 doing.\u201d 1 \u201cHow 1 very 1 odd 1 of 1 him!\u201d 1 \u201cSurely 1 you 1 agree?\u201d 1 But 1 Freddy 1 was 1 his 1 mother\u2019s 1 son 1 and 1

1 at 1 Florence, 1 I\u2019ll 1 be 1 bound.\u201d 1 \u201cThe 1 same 1 as 1 Lucy\u2019s 1 got.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 by-the-by, 1 did 1 Miss 1 Honeychurch 1 enjoy 1 London?\u201d 1 \u201cShe 1 came 1

be 1 nearly 1 as 1 stupid 1 as 1 I 1 am, 1 but 1 it\u2019ll 1 be 1 very 1 different 1 now, 1 mother 1 thinks. 1 She 1 will 1 read 1 all 1 kinds 1 of 1 books.\u201d 1 \u201cSo 1 will 1 you.\u201d 1 \u201cOnly 1 medical 1 books. 1 Not 1 books 1 that 1 you 1 can 1 talk 1 about 1 afterwards. 1 Cecil 1 is 1 teaching 1 Lucy 1 Italian, 1 and 1 he 1 says 1 her 1 playing 1 is 1 wonderful. 1 There 1 are 1 all 1 kinds 1 of 1 things 1 in 1 it 1 that 1 we 1 have 1 never 1 noticed. 1 Cecil 1 says--\u201d 1 \u201cWhat 1 on 1 earth 1 are 1 those 1 people 1 doing 1 upstairs? 1 Emerson--we 1 think 1 we\u2019ll 1 come 1 another 1 time.\u201d 1 George 1 ran 1 down-stairs 1 and 1 pushed 1 them 1 into 1 the 1 room 1 without 1 speaking. 1 \u201cLet 1 me 1 introduce 1 Mr. 1 Honeychurch, 1 a 1 neighbour.\u201d 1 Then 1 Freddy 1 hurled 1 one 1 of 1 the 1 thunderbolts 1 of 1 youth. 1 Perhaps 1 he 1 was 1 shy, 1 perhaps 1 he 1 was 1 friendly, 1 or 1 perhaps 1 he 1 thought 1 that 1 George\u2019s 1 face 1 wanted 1 washing. 1 At 1 all 1 events 1 he 1 greeted 1 him 1 with, 1 \u201cHow 1 d\u2019ye 1 do? 1 Come 1 and 1 have 1 a 1 bathe.\u201d 1 \u201cOh, 1 all 1 right,\u201d 1 said 1 George, 1 impassive. 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 was 1 highly 1 entertained. 1 \u201c\u2018How 1 d\u2019ye 1 do? 1 how 1 d\u2019ye 1 do? 1 Come 1 and 1 have 1 a 1 bathe,\u2019\u201d 1 he 1 chuckled. 1 \u201cThat\u2019s 1 the 1 best 1 conversational 1 opening 1 I\u2019ve 1 ever 1 heard. 1 But 1 I\u2019m 1 afraid 1 it 1 will 1 only 1 act 1 between 1 men. 1 Can 1 you 1 picture 1 a 1 lady 1 who 1 has 1

that 1 the 1 sexes 1 are 1 equal.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 tell 1 you 1 that 1 they 1 shall 1 be,\u201d 1 said 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 who 1 had 1 been 1 slowly 1 descending 1 the 1 stairs. 1 \u201cGood 1 afternoon, 1 Mr. 1 Beebe. 1 I 1 tell 1 you 1 they 1 shall 1 be 1 comrades, 1 and 1 George 1 thinks 1 the 1 same.\u201d 1 \u201cWe 1 are 1 to 1 raise 1 ladies 1 to 1 our 1 level?\u201d 1 the 1 clergyman 1 inquired. 1 \u201cThe 1 Garden 1 of 1 Eden,\u201d 1 pursued 1 Mr. 1 Emerson, 1 still 1 descending, 1 \u201cwhich 1 you 1 place 1 in 1 the 1 past, 1 is 1 really 1 yet 1 to 1 come. 1 We 1 shall 1 enter 1 it 1 when 1 we 1 no 1 longer 1 despise 1 our 1 bodies.\u201d 1 Mr. 1 Beebe 1 disclaimed 1 placing 1 the 1 Garden 1 of 1 Eden 1 anywhere. 1 \u201cIn 1 this--not 1 in 1 other 1 things--we 1 men 1 are 1 ahead. 1 We 1 despise 1 the 1 body 1 less 1 than 1 women 1 do. 1 But 1 not 1 until 1 we 1 are 1 comrades 1 shall 1 we 1 enter 1 the 1 garden.\u201d 1 \u201cI 1 say, 1 what 1 about 1 this 1 bathe?\u201d 1 murmured 1 Freddy, 1 appalled 1 at 1 the 1 mass 1 of 1 philosophy 1 that 1 was 1 approaching 1 him. 1 \u201cI 1 believed 1 in 1 a 1 return 1 to 1 Nature 1 once. 1 But 1
